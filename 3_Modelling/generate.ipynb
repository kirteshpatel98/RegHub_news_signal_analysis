Age determination for stars is not as precise as we would like, but it is thought to have formed very shortly after the Big Bang. \\n\\n > Does being the oldest define the age of our galaxy or does its size define the age of our galaxy? Or are the they same?\\n\\nNot exactly. Some of the oldest structures in the Milky Way (globular clusters) provide some limits on the age of the galaxy. It is very likely that the Milky Way began forming almost as soon as possible in cosmological history. Galaxies are dynamic, and often during their lifetime capture smaller collections of stars, so it is not easy to define a singular age, unlike a star. \\n\\n > if a black hole is one of the oldest things and has been around for billions of years, does that mean it has more information or knowledge compared to an AI system developed on Earth today?\\n\\nNo. There is no reason to suspect that black holes, or any astrophysical objects, are intelligent. Information, in the context of black holes, is almost certainly not in a form useful for intelligent life. \\n\\n > Why does it seem that the older things within the galaxy, the bigger they are, and the newer things are the smaller they are?\\n\\nThis is incorrect. In the case of stars, the largest stars evolve and die the fastest. a 100 solar mass star is gone after a few million years. A star like the sun will last billions. So it is extremely likely that a large star is actually the younger object. Nevertheless there is not a simple relation between age and size; you have to consider the physics of the object in question. \\n\\n  > couldn't explain the rotation of spiral galaxies, in the sense that it all rotated at the same speed, from the inside to the outer arm. \\n\\nThe [galaxy rotation curve](_URL_1_) tells you how fast stars are rotating around the center of a galaxy, as a function of the radius from the center. The speeds of the stars depend on the gravitational potential of the galaxy. You can make a prediction of what this potential is, and hence what the curve would look like, by measuring the matter you can see in the galaxy with a telescope. Measurements of this curve, made by directly measuring the speeds of the stars in a galaxy, conflict with this prediction.\\n\\nThis is the origin of why we think dark matter exists. It is merely matter we cannot see, which modifies the galactic potential so that the measured rotation curves make sense. The other hypothesis, modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), is to invoke a scale dependence of gravity on distance, which accounts for the rotation curve. \\n\\nAt the moment, there are some really good reasons to believe that dark matter exists. (MOND has much less support behind it.) What, exactly, it is remains unknown. Perhaps it is just ordinary matter too cold for us to see. Perhaps dark matter is small black holes. Perhaps it is a gas of weakly-interacting particles that don't interact electromagnetically. There are arguments for or against these ideas; perhaps dark matter is a mixture of these things, or something else we haven't thought of. All we know is that, short of modifying gravity, that matter has to be there.\"],\n",

We see real numbers pop up more frequently because they help us quantify measure and scale. Of particular importance is multiplication for real numbers; if you take a (positive) real number r and see what it does to every real number then you will find that it zooms the number line in and out. Which has obvious direct applications, eg proportionality.\\n\\nFor complex numbers, multiplication is just as important but more powerful. In a similar way to real number, multiplication by complex numbers will scale things up/down, but it also *rotates* the complex plane. Rotation is super important and complex numbers are important because their arithmetic is intimately tied with rotation. They arise in more complicated contexts, because rotation + scale is more complicated than just scale, but they do arise as \"just as real\" as real numbers. For instance, quantum mechanical systems are quantified using complex numbers and how they interact as \"real\" things depends on the \"rotational scale\" between them. We could (probably) do all of planar trigonometry with complex numbers instead of sine and cosine we just happened to develop it without complex numbers first. Though there are many applications where they do act as middlemen to avoid complications with trigonometry and to take advantage of the many powerful tools associated to complex numbers.\\n\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nAs for Complex Angle, yes you can. In case you have not heard, there is the notion of \"Hyperbolic Trigonometry\", which does to hyperbolas what trigonometry does with circles. To understand this, we need to know a bit about regular circular trigonometry.\\n\\nThe notion of an \"angle\" in circular trigonometry is usually defined using arclength. If you have an angle, draw a circle of radius R centered at the point of intersection of the angle, then find the arclength L along this circle from the first line in the angle to the second. The angle is defined as T=L/R. Because all circles are similar, this number does not depend on the radius of the circle you chose. This is how it is *usually* done. But we actually don\\'t want this. Instead, we want to define it using area. If we have the same angle and circle, then instead of computing the arclength, we can compute the area of the wedge of the circle defined by this angle, A. There is a relationship between this area and the angle as usually computed, namely A =TR^(2)/2, and this means we can actually use this area to *define* what an angle is. So we define the angle of an intersection to be T= 2A/R^(2), where A is the area of the circular sector made by the angle. Note that when R=1, we just have that T is twice the area of this sector (note, again, that since circles are similar, this value does not depend on the radius chosen).\\n\\nWith this notion of an angle, we are able to \"parameterize\" the entire circle. For every angle T between 0 and 2pi, there is a unique point on the circle given by x^(2)+y^(2)=1. We call this unique point (cos(T),sin(T)), which is where cosine and sine come from. It turns out that, since angles have nice properties, you get things like the angle addition formula, etc.\\n\\nWe can play a similar game, but with hyperbolas. The hyperbola of \"radius\" R is given by the equation x^(2) - y^(2) = R^(2) and we\\'ll view this \"centered\" at the origin. This hyperbola has two pieces to it, but we\\'ll just concern ourselves with the righthand portion of it. If we have a point on this hyperbola, then we can draw a line from it to the origin. We also have the line along the x-axis from the origin to the hyperbola at (R,0). These two lines form an intersection and, with the hyperbola itself, bound an area that is a \"hyperbolic sector\", which has some area A, and we define the hyperbolic angle associated with this intersection, S, to be the value S = 2A/R^(2), just like with the circle. As before, this value only depends on the intersection, not the \"radius\" of the hyperbola. So, when R=1, we have S=2A.\\n\\nJust as above, for every real number S, we can find a unique point on the (right portion of the) hyperbola whose hyperbolic angle is S. So on the \"unit hyperbola\" x^(2)-y^(2)=1, given an S, there is a point on it corresponding to this S that we all (cosh(S), sinh(S)). Since hyperbolic angles have nice properties, you get things like the hyperbolic angle addition formula, etc.\\n\\nSo we have two notions of \"angle\" and two different versions of the trigonometric functions to go along with them. It turns out that these idea can be unified using the notion of \"complex angles\". It turns out that these two kinds of trigonometric/hyperbolic functions are just weird manifestations of exponentiation. There is the famous [Euler Formula](_URL_0_) which gives us\\n\\n* cos(T) = (e^(iT) + e^(-iT))/2\\n\\n* sin(T) = (e^(iT) - e^(-iT))/2i\\n\\nThere is also the hyperbolic version of this:\\n\\n* cosh(S) = (e^(S) + e^(-S))/2\\n\\n* sinh(S) = (e^(S) - e^(-S))/2\\n\\nThis is *usually* just given to you as what the hyperbolic trig functions *are*, which is a shame because the link to the hyperbola is gone and it\\'s just a dumb formula. But there\\'s [really nice geometric proofs of this formula for hyperbolic functions](_URL_2_).\\n\\nNotice some similarities between these. Note that it kinda looks like cos(T)=cosh(iT) and similarly for sine. In a way, it looks like the circular angle is an *imaginary* hyperbolic angle. So we\\'ve been working with imaginary angles all this time! These relationships, along with the addition formulas, can allow us to define trig functions that input complex angles. Particularly, we can define C(x+iy) and S(x+iy) as follows:\\n\\n* C(x+iy) = cosh(x)cos(y) + i\\\\*sinh(x)sin(y)\\n\\n* S(x+iy) = sinh(x)cos(y) + i\\\\*cosh(x)sin(y)\\n\\nNote that\\n\\n* C(x) = cosh(x)    and    C(iy) = cos(y)\\n\\n* S(x) = sinh(x)   and   S(iy) = i\\\\*sin(y)\\n\\nso we, essentially, get all the trig and hyperbolic functions back from this where \"real\" angles are hyperbolic angles and \"imaginary\" angles are trig angles. You can also check that the angle addition formula holds for S(z) and C(z) (in the form of the hyperbolic angle addition formulas). So, these are functions that naturally generalize the trig and hyperbolic functions and can input any *complex* value as their angle.\\n\\nSo what? What\\'s good or useful or geometric about this? It turns out that there is an important geometric interpretation for these guys. Before, we were looking at the circle and hyperbola as the solutions to x^(2)+y^(2)=1 and x^(2)-y^(2)=1 respectively. Intuitively, then, since these new functions contain *both* of the ordinary trig functions, they should, in some way, help us parameterize some kind of geometric object that has both a circle and a hyperbola in it. And that\\'s exactly what they do!\\n\\nConsider the solutions to the equation z^(2) - w^(2) = 1 where, now, we are interested in any *complex* values solution. So, for instance, (0,i) is a point on this thing. In fact, note that (cos(T),i\\\\*sin(T)) is always going to be a point on this thing. This means that, whatever this thing is, it has the unit circle in it. On the other hand, note that (cosh(S),sinh(S)) are also solutions to this thing, and so it *also* contains the unit hyperbola on it. It turns out that the geometric object that z^(2)-w^(2)=1 gives us is a one-sheeted [Hyperboloid](_URL_1_). The unit circle is the circle at the cinch and the hyperbola is the profile of it. Even more, though, for every complex number z, the point (C(z),S(z)) is a point on this hyperboloid and, finally, given any point on this hyperboloic there is a complex angle z (unique if you restrict the imaginary part to between -ipi and ipi) so that the point is given by this complex angle. So even \"mixed\" angles like 3 + ipi/2 is defines a point on some place in between the circle and hyperbola.\\n\\n(We sometimes call this hyperboloid a \"Complex Hyperbola\" since it uses the same formula as a hyperbola but we look for complex solutions. But we could just as easily call it a \"Complex Circle\" because when we try to use the circle equation z^(2)+w^(2)=1, then we automatically get a point on the hyperbolic one since z^(2)+w^(2)=z^(2)-(iw)^(2)=1. In other words, in the complex world, there is no difference between circles and hyperbolas.)\\n\\n**TL;DR** Yes! There are complex angles. The corresponding complex trigonometric functions that use them generalize circular and hyperbolic geometry, and correspond, geometrically, to a \"Hyperboloid\".'],\n",

       "  'text': ['**Background:** Psychologists have debated for many decades about how to define, qualify, and quantify \"intelligence.\"  Traditionally, intelligence has been defined as the set of personal characteristics that correlate with later academic success.  These include things like spatial ability and vocabulary comprehension.  Many different theories of intelligence were proposed; google Weschler or Spearman for some examples.\\n\\n**Howard Gardner** decided that the idea of a unified intelligence did not fully capture the idea of intelligence.  He argued that there are multiple intelligences, some of them correlating with academic potential and others not.  His criteria for something to be considered \"an intelligence\" basically included things like it has to be a distinct category of functions and correspond to a certain brain region.  \"Linguistic intelligence,\" for example, qualifies because it involves a distinct set of core operations (word definitions, syntax) and specific brain regions (say, Wernicke\\'s and Broca\\'s regions.) **Kinesthetic Intelligence** was one of his proposed intelligences for people who are dexterous or athletic.\\n\\nSome people like Gardner\\'s theory.  It says that a person can be intelligent if they are an athlete but do not have good grades.  It has had some practical success in the classroom because it encourages teaching material in a variety of different ways. Many of Gardner\\'s peers, however, criticized the approach for multiple reasons.  \\n\\n* If \"intelligence\" used to be \"things that predict future academic performance\" but now isn\\'t, then what is it?  What do we gain with this new definition? He\\'s not contributing much to theory, they argued. \\n\\n* Gardner didn\\'t create new tests for his intelligences, but rather relied upon the work of previous researchers\\' work on intelligence or personality.  He\\'s not contributing much to measuring intelligence.  \\n\\n* Many of Gardner\\'s intelligences overlap quite a bit; Spatial intelligence and Logical-mathematical intelligence, for example, tend to go together because people who can visualise things spatially also tend to be adept at mathematics.  So if these are two separate intelligences, but they seem to predict the same behavior, why should we consider them separate intelligences? \\n\\n* some of these things, like Naturalistic intelligence, may actually be a measurement of personality traits (how good we are at building fires improves with practice and how much we enjoy camping) rather than a component of intelligence.\\n\\nNow, it\\'s not that people who have, say, Social intelligence aren\\'t valuable to society, and can\\'t have awesome jobs.  (Intelligence isn\\'t necessarily predictive of financial success; IQ and hard work are not the same thing).  It\\'s just that most psychologists prefer to constrain the definition of \"intelligence\" to mean things that correlate with problem solving and academics. \\n\\n\\n\\nSo, the **TL;DR:**\\n\\nKinetic Intelligence was Howard Gardner\\'s idea that some people are athletic (or otherwise physically dexterous), and learn better by doing something with their bodies rather than reading.\\n\\nSome people can\\'t do cartwheels because they are simply uncoordinated.  This can be due to any number of reasons that could be related to practice, nutrition, the environment, genetics, etc.'],\n",

Classical uncertainty is the kind we\\'re used to from everyday life, nothing up my quantum sleeves. If I tell you I have a quarter in one of my hands, guess which?, then your subjective state of knowledge is a mixed state of \"it\\'s in the left hand\" and \"it\\'s in the right hand.\"\\n\\nWhat makes quantum mixed states interesting is the contrast with a coherent superposition, e.g. \"left *plus* right.\" At the macro level of quarters in hands, this leads to all sorts of weird Schrodinger\\'s cat type paradoxes, so it\\'s easier to think about a single two-level system, like a spin.\\n\\nIn some basis (call it z), a spin can be |up > ; it can be |down > ; it can be any superposition of a|up >  + b|down > . Any (complex) numbers you put in for a and b, this will still represent a pure state (normalize it if you insist). What makes it pure is this: **there is *some* axis you could measure it along, where you would be *certain* to get the up result; and the opposite axis, along which you\\'d be *certain* to get down.** This isn\\'t obvious if you\\'re not used to quantum mechanics, but an example will help:\\n\\nLet\\'s say you have the state |up >  + |down >  (I don\\'t normalize). If you measure along the z-axis, you are equally likely to get up as down (this is what you\\'d call \"quantum indeterminacy\"). But if you measure along the x-axis, you will get right always and left never!\\n\\nSimilarly if you have |up >  - |down > , along the x-axis you will get left always and right never.\\n\\nOn the other hand, let\\'s say you prepare *either* |up >  *or* |down >  with 50% probability. This is NOT the same as the coherent state |up >  + |down > . We have to write this as what\\'s called a **density matrix**, which is a different formalism (can explain more technically if anyone\\'s interested.) The upshot is that no matter *what* axis you measure along, you\\'ll get up/down (along that axis) with 50% probability; there\\'s no axis of certainty.\\n\\nAnother way in which mixed states arise is through considering only half of an entangled pair. There\\'s definite information in the correlations between the two particles, but with access to only one of them, it behaves in the unpredictable way described above.\\n\\nWhat makes mixed states weird in QM is (among other things) that there\\'s no unique decomposition (think reverse engineering) into pure states. That \"up OR down\" state is identical in every respect to a \"right OR left\" state, or a 50-50 combination of any two orthogonal states. This leads some people (ok, myself included) to think of the density matrix formalism as more fundamental than the state-vector formalism, which among other things can\\'t assign a state to the subsystems of an entangled pair.',\n",
       "   'Several commenters have touched on this already, but I\\'d like to clarify the language around mixed states being states which you lack knowledge about.\\n\\nIn particular, \"real\" systems, that is, real atoms, molecules, photons, etc. are *always* pure states.  As far as physics is concerned, the universe is one unitarily evolving pure wavefunction (which, as others have pointed out, can of course be in a superposition state).\\n\\nSo then how does one reconcile the manifest pure-ness of the universal wavefunction with our inability to describe certain quantum states?\\n\\nUsually, it might be exceedingly difficult to write down the full state describing a particular quantum system.  Consider a molecule of N2 floating around in your room.  There\\'s a wavefunction which describes this molecule, but this molecule is also highly entangled with many other molecules around it.  Further, every collision of that molecule with another introduces an ever more complicated pattern of entanglement--so to \"perfectly\" describe the wavefunction of that molecule, you\\'d need to consider an ever growing number of *other* molecules.  Thus, the pure state which describes that molecule gets incredibly complicated incredibly quickly.\\n\\nThankfully, even though this pattern of entanglement is horrifically complicated from moment-to-moment, on *average*, it\\'s quite simple.  The Nitrogen molecule is simply in what is called a \"thermal\" mixed state.  That is, if you plucked any random nitrogen molecule from the air and looked at its energy/velocity, it would be very accurately described by the Boltzmann distribution.  The mathematical tool which describes this sort of uncertainty at the single-particle level is the density matrix.  Thus, you can write down a density matrix which tells you the \"averaged\" state of any such nitrogen molecule.\\n\\nSo, any time you see something described as a mixed state, some sort of averaging process has occurred.  One might be tempted to philosophize about how our state of knowledge of the quantum system changes it, but it really has more to do with your answer to the question, \"How much information am I actually keeping track of?\"  If you\\'re not keeping track of all of the movements of all of the Nitrogen molecules (and other elements) in a room, you can only really hope to model your system with a mixed state because you simply don\\'t have the requisite information to write down its full pure state.\\n\\nSimilarly, if you *did* have perfect information about all the movements of all the atoms and molecules in a room, you *could* write down a pure state describing every atom in your room.'],\n",

Oxidation is the process of losing electrons; reduction is the process of gaining electrons.  There is a redox potential anytime you have two species with different \"reduction potentials\" (essentially different greediness toward electrons.)  Cesium is eager to give up electrons; fluorine is eager to accept them.  Everything else is between these extremes.  Batteries work on this principal - when you connect the anode and cathode, one compound in the battery gives up electrons (and is oxidized) while the other absorbs them (and is reduced.)  You exploit the potential energy difference as you use the battery, in the same way you use gravitational potential energy to slide down a hill.',\n",

It\\'s not the property of a solution itself though, although a solution may have compounds in it that are oxidizing or reducing agents. \\n\\nA potential is (in simple terms) an amount of energy that changes with the position of something. An everyday example is the Earth\\'s gravitational field. The higher up you are, the more gravitational potential energy you have. So it takes a certain amount of energy to completely remove you from Earth. If I put you back in a place that\\'s lower than where you currently are, you\\'d get all that energy back and then some. So if you want to know what the difference is, it\\'s simply related (proportional specifically) to the height difference  The energy to remove you from the planet is big, and so is the energy regained on putting you back, so it\\'s more convenient to just consider the relative energy and not the two absolute energies of one place and another.\\n\\nWe do a similar thing in chemistry, where redox potentials are less often given in absolute values (in which case one speaks of \\'ionization potential\\' and \\'electron affinities), but instead measured relative the reduction of hydrogen ions to hydrogen gas: 2H^+ + 2e^-  < -- >  H2 ([table of standard potentials](_URL_0_))\\n\\nRelative that, the reaction Na^+ + \\u200ae^− -- >  Na(s) has a potential of −2.71 V.

So the reaction is thermodynamically favored, which his why putting metallic sodium in water will produce hydrogen gas and dissolved NaOH.\\n\\nAs with anything, a negative ∆G means it\\'s thermodynamically favorable for the reaction to occur, which is a condition for it to happen, but that doesn\\'t automatically mean it\\'ll happen. It depends on the kinetics, whether the electrons can be transferred. Electrons \\'want\\' to go to where their energy is lower, just as you \\'want\\' to be farther downhill due to gravity, but they also need the energy required to overcome any hills that might be in-between. (in general you have thermodynamic vs kinetic stability for all reactions, not just redox ones)\\n\\nLike other molecules, proteins have redox potentials. Often then it\\'s referring to the redox potential of a specific site in the protein (such as the iron in heme), because you can have many places which can be reduced/oxidized more or less independently of each other, it can also depend on the conditions. \\n\\nAs Albert Szent-Györgyi, discoverer (with Krebs) of the Citric Acid Cycle said \"Life is nothing but an electron looking for a place to rest.',\n",

Elements that are Electronegative (Fluorine  >  Oxygen  >  Nitrogen, etc.) all share a strong desire to receive an electron.  This is because their octets are almost finished (every atom wants to have 8 valence electrons in their orbital shell) and they are small enough that the forces near their nucleus make this craving even larger. \\n\\nLets say two molecules come in near proximity of each other.  One has an O atom on it with a negative charge (O-) and thus has an extra electron than it wants.  The other molecule has an OH double bonded to a carbon.  The hydrogen on the second molecule's OH will be removed (undergo reduction) while the O- atom on the other molecule will receive the H and become OH (oxidized).  This is called a proton transfer reaction (acid-base reaction) and the only thing that happened here was the transfer of a proton (H+ ion) between to oxygen atoms.

       "  'text': ['These are both true statements: \\'An airfoil produces lift because there is a pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing\\'; \\'An airfoil produces lift because it pushes air downward\\'.\\n\\nA lot of people try to draw a distinction between lift due to a pressure differential and lift due to pushing air downward. This is a false dichotomy. Think of it this way: there are two ways that the air and rotor blade interact: viscosity and pressure.\\n\\n**Viscosity and Why I\\'m Ignoring It**\\n\\nViscosity in a fluid causes shear stress in the presence of velocity gradients (there\\'s a more precise mathematical way to say it, but bear with me). Importantly in this discussion, viscous forces between the air and an airfoil act in a direction parallel to the airfoil\\'s surface. An airfoil is mostly flat, so the viscous force acts mostly in the direction parallel to the flow (i.e. the drag direction, not the lift direction). Therefore, it would make sense if viscosity could be neglected in discussions of lift. In fact, empirical measurements of lift show very good agreement with inviscid (ignoring viscosity) calculations. So, despite the many interesting and important phenomena of viscous flow, I\\'m going to ignore viscosity in the rest of this post.\\n\\nPressure, in contrast, acts perpendicularly to the surface of the airfoil. It is the primary means of interaction between wing and air, and the primary force acting between different morsels of air.\\n\\n**Effect of Pressure Gradients**\\n\\nIn our inviscid model, any acceleration of the air is the result of a pressure gradient (an increase in pressure in a certain direction.) To envision the effect of these gradients, imagine a discrete morsel of air, small enough that pressure, velocity, and other properties are uniform throughout the morsel, but large enough that you don\\'t need to think of it as individual particles. If pressure increases in the direction of this morsel\\'s velocity, then there will be more force pushing on the front than the back, and it will slow down. Conversely, decreasing pressure in the direction of velocity will speed up the air. This is the conceptual basis behind Bernoulli\\'s principle.\\n\\nGradients perpendicular to velocity will not change the speed of the morsel, but will cause curvature in the direction of decreasing pressure. The pressure differential between sides of the morsel provides the centripetal force that curves the air\\'s path.\\n\\nGradients with both parallel and perpendicular components will change both speed and direction.\\n\\n**Pressure and Deflection**\\n\\nNow that that\\'s out of the way, let\\'s get back to the wing. Imagine the airfoil staying stationary, with air flowing past. Because air cannot pass through the airfoil, it will split into two sections, flowing above and below the airfoil. The two paths will rejoin at the trailing edge of the blade. If the trailing edge is pointed downward (the front is pointed upwards), then the faster air along the upper surface will have a lower pressure than the slower air along the lower surface, and the blade will experience lift from this pressure differential.\\n\\nSo far, this explanation sounds just like the equal transit time fallacy. The important difference is the mechanism behind this pressure differential. Rather than some anthropomorphic \"need\" for the airstreams to meet back up exactly as they left, the speed and pressure changes are explained by the effects of pressure differentials described above. (In fact, the faster air along the longer upper surface of the blade will beat the slower air to the edge. If anything, the equal transit time fallacy will understate the lift.)\\n\\nWhen the two airstreams meet again at the trailing edge, they will keep going in the direction of the trailing edge. If the trailing edge is pointed downwards, then that means that both upper and lower streams must be deflected downward. This is caused by pressure gradients in both streams, with pressure increasing in the upward direction.\\n\\nLook at the top stream first. Far away from the airfoil in all directions, the pressure will be uniform. This is called the freestream pressure. For an upward pressure gradient to exist on top of the airfoil, then, the pressure on top of the airfoil must be lower than freestream pressure.\\n\\nOn the lower side, conversely, an upward pressure gradient requires that the pressure below the airfoil be higher than freestream pressure. With higher-than-freestream pressure on the bottom, and lower-than-freestream pressure on top, the wing experiences a net upward lift.\\n\\nNote that the pressure distribution around the wing is intimately linked to the downward deflection of air. It is wrong to try to separate the two as if each contributes to lift individually. It\\'s the equivalent of saying \"My car is starting to move partially because my foot is pushing the accelerator and partially because the engine is turning the wheels.\"',\n",

       "  'text': [\"You are right that we could use a lot of different elements. And people have been trying with most of the reasonable (and sometime less reasonable) one. [Here is a cool image of a Hall thruster](_URL_3_) firing with xenon (top left), bismuth (top right), magnesium (bottom left) and Zinc (top right). But to understand why you would want to change I think it's good to summarize what advantages and issues xenon has.\\n\\nOn the plus side, xenon is **heavy**. This may seem a bit counter-intuitive to people who are used to more classical propulsion systems but in electric/plasma propulsion we usually want to limit the Isp and raise the thrust. A heavy ion with a low charge to mass ratio is ejected slower but give you more thrust for your input energy. The second thing is that xenon is a noble gas, that means you do **not have to worry about chemical reactions**, material compatibility, metal or ceramics oxydation. The only thing you can do to it is remove some electrons. That simplifies the modeling and makes sure that the energy spend is either ionizing the gas or accelerating it. You don't wast it breaking molecules.\\n\\nOn the disadvantage side xenon is expensive. Several thousands of dollars a kg. It also doesn't store as nicely as other stuff. For example at reasonable temperature you need to get it to about 100 bars to liquefy it. This means heavy and expensive tanks. \\n\\nLastly, while it is **easier to ionize than the other noble gas**, it is not as easy as some of the metals or the heavier elements.\\n\\n\\nSo if you take your periodic table one of the more natural idea is to switch to next heavy noble gas, radon. It's heavier and easier to ionize. However, slight problem, it is very radioactive and its most stable isotope has a half life of 3 days. So it's a nightmare to use and impossible to store. Too bad, that would have a made a very high performance thruster. \\n\\nNext you can look at some of the heavy metal. A fairly obvious one is mercury, it's liquide at ambiant pressure and temperature (easy to store), cheap, abundant and easy to ionize. Under vacuum it vaporizes quite easily. In fact some of the earlier thrusters were mercury fed (see the [SERT-1 mission](_URL_0_)). The issue of mercury is that it [amalgames with aluminium and other metals and turn them to paste](_URL_1_). That's not good with satellites usually made out of a lot of aluminium. It is also slightly toxic to humans which complicates the testing on the ground. Similarly cesium has been used on early thrusters. Being an alkali metal it has a very low ionization energy. You need to keep it hot to get it to vaporize but it's not too bad. However like mercury is attacks other metals and is toxic. It is also very dangerous as it can violently react if it comes in contact with moisture. In the same veine bismuth has been tried to but the high vaporization temperature makes it less than practical. Metals also always have the risk of re-depositing on the spacecraft and coating the solar panels or optical instruments.\\n\\n\\nSince heavy metals are not that practical we can also look at lighter stuff. Sure it doesn't help the thrust but it might be an acceptable trade off. The next lighter noble gas is krypton. It's about 3x less expensive than xenon IIRC and it makes a nice deep purple/blue plume. However it is harder to ionize and not easier to store so people usually feel like the performance hit is not worth the cost saving on the propellant. It is also harder to pump during ground testing so you need to have top of the line test chambers to use it. One use that have been proposed is to test some of the bigger thrusters like the [X3 Hall thruster](_URL_2_) and save a bit of money when you are not doing performance measurements.\\n\\nOne of the more serious contender is actually iodine. It nearly has the same molar mass and ionization energy as xenon so the thrusters are already pretty much optimized for it. It is relatively inexpensive and more importantly you can store it as a solid around 1 bar. It also sublimates really easily under vacuum with only the help of a tiny bit of heat. This means that you could store it in much lighter tanks and have them be pretty much any shape you want. It doesn't have that much of a risk of coating the spacecraft since it sublimates very easily. However people are a bit reticent because it can be slightly reactive with some metals and is a bit toxic. That means that if you want to try it you have to dedicate a test chamber to it. It also poses some still unclear issues on the cathode side of the thruster. But IMHO this is the strongest alternative right now. Busek is suppose to test an iodine fed thruster in space soon and a lot of new space startup are betting on iodine.\\n\\n**TL;DR**: Heavier elements are not practical to work with and/or are toxic to humans and the spacecraft. Lighter elements have pretty bad performances. The only serious alternative is iodine.\"],\n",

These establish \"waves\" in the lattice, where the lattice breaks from it\\'s normal even distribution, forming regions of higher positive charge, attracting another electron to this region and establishing a link between the two electrons (which will have opposite spins to one another). The electrons now act like one linked particle (called a cooper pair), a boson (neutral spin). When the material is cooled sufficiently the electrons will all do this at once forming a Bose-Einstein Condensate. Now all the electrons have dropped from their energy levels, seemingly breaking the Pauli exclusion principle (no two electrons can occupy the same orbital unless they have opposite spin, and seeing as there are only two spin states there can only be two electrons per orbital). Every electron in the lattice is now in the lowest energy orbital possible, all of them are linked. Now it takes a surprising amount of energy to stop something from superconducting, you\\'d expect that if you just bumped out of the electrons out of it\\'s pairing that any neat properties would disappear, but because they\\'re all linked you can\\'t just break one pair, you have to put enough energy in to raise ALL the electrons to proper orbitals (all the electrons in a lattice interact in any material, so all the electrons of the same spin will occupy different orbitals, requiring different amounts of energy to get them there, this is why large lattice based structures generally form in very, very high energy environments e.g. diamond).  \\n\\nAn external magnetic field will exert a torque on electrons in the material, attempting to align them with the field, this would break the cooper pairings and so they will only switch when the field is of sufficient strength.

       "   'I was an engineer in the Undersea Telecom business for a couple decades running the groups that designed the terminals and repeaters, so let me try to answer with an \\'insider engineer\\' view:\\n\\n- The cables may eventually decay, but not in any practical amount of time.  They will be on the bottom looking pretty much like they do today long after you, I, and our grandchildren are gone.  When I worked the systems (from 1980\\'s to 2000\\'s though the designs are pretty much identical today) the *operational* lifetimes for the cables were 25 years, and the materials were selected to last much longer than that.  (The technology became obsolete long before the hardware degraded.)\\n* The majority of the hardware on the bottom consists of cables about an inch in diameter.  It has optical fibers at its very core surrounded by high tensile strength steel -- picture a steel cable 1/2\" in diameter, pull the center strand out and replace it with a little oil- or elastomer-filled tube).  That is surrounded by copper that has been swaged (pressed) around the steel - imagine putting the cable in a piece of copper pipe and pulling it through a die so the copper squishes around the cable to make it completely airtight.  This copper carries the current that powers the repeater and provides a gas seal to keep gasses from diffusing into the fiber, which can damage it.  The copper is then surrounded by about 1/4\" thick polyethylene - kinda like the stuff milk jugs are made of.  Near the shore - mostly on the continental shelf - this is a layer of armored wire over this to reduce damage from trawler fishing nets and dragging anchors.\\nThe cable is also buried (\\'plowed\\' under, in the business) a couple/few meters near the shore to provide physical protection.\\n* The majority of the cable out in the middle of the ocean, though, looks like a white 1\" plastic pipe just laying on the bottom.\\n* The cables are for the most part left on the bottom when retired.  It is a very complex technical operation to get them back up.  The mid-ocean can be miles deep, and the forces to get the cable back up - just because of the weight of the cable itself - are tremendous.  If they break when you pull them up, the ends whip around like a bullwhip from hell that can easily kill people and destroy equipment, so it isn\\'t a job taken lightly.  And when you get it on board, there are just tons and tons of it, worth practically nothing by weight, so why bother...\\n* Every 100-ish km there is a beryllium-copper \\'bottle\\' containing electronics and optics that groom the signal and send it on (that is worthy of a post on its own) The distance between these bottles varies with different generations of designs.  These things weight around 300 kg, are maybe 50 cm in diameter and a meter or two long (depending on manufacturer and generation) and they will be there longer than the polyethylene.  Our great^5 grandchildren could polish them to a shine.\\n*  It turns out that from the 80\\'s to the 10\\'s new technology developed rapidly, and deployed systems became obsolete quickly.  The technology was not amenable to upgrade, so they were abandoned.  The thirst for bandwidths also grew exponentially, so more and more systems were laid.  In the last 10 years or so, technologies have become available to upgrade systems by replacing shore equipment, so there is now some re-use.  However, the growing thirst for bandwidth is still driving new system deployments, though not as rapidly as in the past.\\n\\nI hope this helps!',\n",

[This](_URL_0_) study shows is that ion channels are an important factor for the initiation of embryonic pacemaker cells; specifically Ca2+ through Ins-p3 dependent shuttle. They hypothesize that Ins-p3 releases Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) too a point of depletion. The depletion of Ca2+ from the ER results in oscillatory levels of intracellular Ca2+ (I couldn't find what pathway(s) intracellular Ca2+ then follows). But they find that inhibiting Ins-p3 did severely impact the beating of embryonic pacemaker cells as a result of reduced affinity for Ca2+ (I might have misread this part) as Ca2+ is an important molecule for all muscle contraction. In short, Ca2+ movement in and out of the cell is important for exciting embryonic cardiomyocytes and it might be a overstimulation of Ca2+ movement that may be the origin of the first beat.\\n\\nP.S. - I understand that the last part of this comment may be speculative, however, it was taken from the discussion section of the paper and I thought it provided an interesting idea that answers OP question.\\n\\nThere is a lot of molecular biology behind this phenomenon and tbh I got lost reading through the paper.

       "  'text': [\"EDIT, ALL THAT WORK FOR A 5 DAYS OLD QUESTION. i Sincerely hope someone reads this!\\n\\nLet me dig into what I was taught my Computer Architecture class, which I passed last semester.\\n\\nImagine computing like a building. At the penthouse there's the user level. At the basement, there's the physical level: electrons, holes, Si molecules, impurities etc. Every level above is an abstraction of the level below. Since a computer system ultimately uses the predictable outcomes of physical laws to compute things, It would be unimaginably complex to directly manipulate electrons and currents in a programmable way. Therefore, we have created several intermediary abstraction levels in order to manipulate things in an electronic scale and gather information from them.\\n\\nEvery level dumps requests to the lower levels, processes the input from them and pushes the result of this process to the upper level. If you are on a certain level, the only thing you need to know is how to read the requests from above, pass them below, receive the outcome and push it back up. Therefore you need two languages: one to talk to the level above and one to talk to the level below. The higher-level languages will be more abstracted, less verbose and closer to human understanding. The lower-level languages give you the ability to optimize the problem according to the specific capabilities of the particular lower-level machine you're talking to, but they're almost impossible to utilize for complex, abstract problems such as creating a GUI interface or whatever.\\n\\nThis helps solve a remarkable problem: We can order our computer to calculate the result of 1+1 without being concerned with what happens below: The user demands, the application returns the result, that's it! We don't have to know anything about the impurities in Si that create n and p gates, that these gates form diodes and transistors, that these transistors form logic gates, that these logic gates form the ALU (the thang in your CPU  that does the calculationes) and the Cache (the short-term memory of your system, the notebook where all operations in the CPU that are scheduled for execution are kept) and all the other components of your machine. These components are coordinated by a language of micro-operations. e.g.: read ram position A and push the result to register K. Put the results of register K into the ALU and shift all the bits to the left.\\n\\nThis micro-instructions are combined into larger instructions that are common in all computations: addition, branching, multiplication, comparison, storage, etc. That level is the ISA level, the Instruction Set Architecture level. THIS is the level the Operating System talks to. Every class of processors has the same ISA, and this is precisely the reason why Intel and AMD CPUs can run the same operating systems, but the CPU of a PS3 can't. Although the inner workings of an i7 and an FX are different, they can run the same operating systems because they have the same ISA.\\n\\nNow instead of going from bottom to top, let's go from top to bottom.\\n\\nBelow the user level, there's the application level, with the Operating System level right below that. Let's say the user has 2 demands: print a document, and run a computer simulation.\\n\\nThe applications will make system calls: One will need a lot of CPU and no printer, the other almost no CPU and lots of printer. The OS will then coordinate these calls: it will divide processing time between the two tasks. It will use the USB to send the correct signal to the printer and the HDMI port to the display. It will assign different cores fo the CPU to operations it realizes they can be executed simultaneously. In order to do these things, there are two ways: either have an application which is a-priori compiled in the machine-language, or interpret the high-level commands in blocks as needed. In the case of interpreted languages, the OS handles that task as well.\\n\\nWe have therefore completely defined the OS level. TLDR, it takes requests from the application level, translates them to the ISA level, then takes the result from the ISA level and pushes it back up to the application.\"],\n",

This can result in a sand grains edge bulging out to accommodate these errors and then looking oblong. This diffusion of holes can fuse grains together at their boundaries! The direction of movement of this is generally away and perpendicular from the direction the force is coming from so the grains end up appearing flattened and oblique.

We don't necessarily know why they did it, but they survived long enough that the holes closed up.\\n\\nLater we have historical evidence that barbers would cut people open. A reason for this would perhaps of been for removing kidney stones. This was incredibly dangerous and the hippocratic oath includes the line *'I shall not cut for stone'* - this is in line with the principles he established of *'first do no harm'.* (so, barbers became the first surgeons, and it is partially from this origin that a surgeon in some countries becomes 'Mr' after becoming a Dr) the hippocratic oath also includes other beauties such as *In every house where I come I will enter only for the good of my patients, keeping myself far from all intentional ill-doing and all seduction and especially from the pleasures of love with women or men, be they free or slaves.*\\n\\nVery high surgical mortality persisted until the 19th century (and was hence only done when there was no other option) until the adoption of listerian techniques - hand washing and sterilisation etc.\\n\\nAnother great advance was the development of anaesthetic because now the patient wasn't in immense pain and moving around so much. The first surgical anaesthetic was delivered in 1847 at Mass General Hospital in the 'ether dome'. I visited there in January this year and it was almost a religious experience for me.\\n\\nEven as late as the 1900s, surgical mortality remained high though. At one Melbourne hospital, the law dictated that 3 surgeons must be consulted before opening the abdomen, as mortality was 80% [briliant reference well worth reading](_URL_0_).\\nHowever much of this was probably due to the slow adoption of sterile technique.\\n\\nSo how did they work out what to do? \\nIt wasn't all trial and error, but certainly it played a part. Before a surgeon performed a procedure, he would likely have trained on many cadavers, have a very good understanding of the anatomy, and perhaps have operated on animals. This is certainly true of cardiac surgery in the early days, as you will find if you watch the series.\\nAfter successful operations,  surgeon would often lecture on it, teach other surgeons, who would evaluate technique, perform their own procedures, and find things that made it simpler/less blood loss/faster recovery etc. studies would be published detailing morbidity and mortality on various techniques, and in this way it continues to disseminate.\\n\\nsto how we get to the point of chilling bodies and attaching them to heart lung machines before operating for extensive times on the heart, it was an iterative and evolutionary process which developed with a clear focus on what had worked in the past, a deep understanding of physiology and anatomy, a steady hand, and extensive training of not just a dedicated team of surgeons but also other OR support staff who play a crucial role in a good outcome.\",\n",

Find what you are operating on. If you want to take it out, you dissect around it, identify the blood supply, and cut it out.  \\n\\nEverything new is essentially a modification on basic principles. You identify a new approach. You have a new way of dissecting down. You identify a complication of a past surgery and try to improve upon it.  \\n\\nMany modifications during surgery are small. X laser is being used for improved bleeding control in some specialty or Y instrument is being used by someone or other. Surgeons try these modifications, apply them to new organs and new procedures. Slowly, modifications such as this and people trying new things lead to a new procedure. Sometimes the changes are included in a research trial, sometimes they don't need to be.\\n\\nI wish I could say it wasn't trial and error at times. Especially, in the early days, there was a lot of trial and error. Even approved methods are trialed by surgeons who want to adapt them into their practice. We are seeing a lot of innovation with robotic surgery now. I've seen many surgeons take a patient and say that they generally do whatever procedure laparoscopically (with a camera and long instruments through small holes) but they want to try it with the robot this time.

       "  'text': ['At the end of the day the output of Data Mining is used to describe something for a given set of conditions.  So yes you can in my opinion. The general answer though is how well it performs, which is another story.\\n\\nBefore I begin, I classify a prediction method as any process that can be used to try to determine an outcome.  Ranges from the simple Generalized Linear Mixed Models to complex decision forests.   These guys can get fractal, where the prediction method outputs are really inputs to other prediction methods. \\n\\nA predictor is an attribute that you are measuring of the data that you are trying to predict an outcome of.\\n\\nNow on to the question.  It depends upon a couple of things.\\n\\n1.  What is the cost of being wrong and how wrong can you be and still be right?\\nIt just really depends upon how often that prediction is right, for a given value of right.  I know that sounds like a cop out, but this is really necessary to understand.  If you have a model that consistently predicts that 30 people will buy something, and the actual observed average (or expectation) is 29, is that close enough to be considered \"right?\"  Quite frankly, the only real answer to that question is how much does it cost you to be wrong.  Basically, if 29 people come in to the store to buy gum and you predicted 30, then the opportunity cost of a pack of gum that you stocked for and didnt sell was something like a $1.00. Not a real loss and that is probably close enough for you to make informed business decisions using your algorithms. Now on the other hand, if you predicted 30 aircraft carriers would be bought and only sold 29, you just lost $10Billion dollars, much more painful, and your prediction is probably not worth making a business decision on even though you were off by only 1 again.\\n\\n2.  How good are the methods you using to make a prediction or decision?\\nThe second issue to understand is the quality of prediction models/algorithms/funny jokes.  If you have bad prediction models it doesn\\'t matter how good of a data set that you have, at the end of the day the things you are using to predict with don\\'t really correspond with the data and with that your veracity goes away.  A great example of this is a simple prediction: sky color = pink all time.  If you only have a prediction method that makes a prediction of the sky being pink by visually checking the sky only at dawn, then of course you are going to say the sky is pink.  Flawed predictor method, really good data set.\\n\\n3. What kind of data are you trying to predict with?\\nThe third issue is what kind of historic data that you have.  If you have historic data that is noisier than you can handle, full of lies, or changes faster than your prediction models adapt, then the data is no good.  No history = no data mining.  \\n\\nSo to answer your question, yes, you can make prediction about a person using data mining techniques, provided that 2 and 3 line up, and for 1 you have a suitable tolerance whose cost for error (and by that I mean distance the predicted value is from the actual value)  is well within the expected reward range for being close enough.'],\n",

       "  'text': ['Bending plastic is a different mechanism than bending metal.  Also, there are two different kinds of bending: Plastic deformation is where the object remains permanently deformed after bending, and elastic deformation is bending where the object springs back to it\\'s original shape.\\n\\nAs for elastic deformation in a crystalline material (like metal), on one side the atoms in the crystal are being pulled apart slightly causing that side of the object to be slightly longer, and on the other side they are being pushed together, making that side slightly shorter (I assumed a bending bar, you can also stretch or squeeze, or twist or shear).  Because of this, when you elastically bend a material, how hard it is to bend (called the [modulus of elasticity](_URL_2_)) is actually a measure of the strength of the interatomic bonds of the crystalline material.\\n\\nAt some point of applied force (known as [stress](_URL_4_ in engineering circles) plastic deformation will begin to occur.  This is distinct from elastic deformation in that it is irreversible.  What makes this different, is that you are causing a permanent movement of atoms throughout the crystal lattice (lattice just means the grid of atoms that make up the crystal).\\n\\nFundamental to this idea is that crystals of materials are not perfect.  What I mean by this is that there might be a missing plane of atoms in the middle of the crystal, or there might be an extra plane of atoms, or there might be a twist in the crystal structure.  These are called [dislocations](_URL_1_).  In order for there to be plastic deformation, there **must** be dislocation motion (the correct technical term is called \"dislocation slip\").  When you stress an object, you are causing a stress field through the material, and once that stress field reaches a certain threshold, you cause the dislocations to move through the material.  Before there is dislocation motion is called elastic deformation which I discussed above.  The point at which dislocations begin to move is called the yield stress.  The point after which dislocations are moving is called plastic deformation.  When the stress is removed, the dislocations remain in their new spot (instead of jumping back to their original spot).  This is what causes the permanent change in shape.\\n\\nJust like there is a certain amount of energy required to push a car up over a hill before it can roll down the other side, a certain amount of energy is required to push a dislocation to the next \"spot\" in the crystal.  This energy level required is what determines how strong the material is (mentioned above as yield stress).  All of these ideas are inter-related and I hope I did not confuse you up to this point.\\n\\nOn an interesting side note: If you want to make a material stronger, you can increase the energy required to move a dislocation, or in other words make the hill taller that you are pushing a car up.  This will require you to insert more energy to get the dislocation or car to the top of the hill.  In materials, this \"heightening\" can be done in many different ways.  One of the first ways ever discovered was the invention of steel, where carbon atoms are inserted into the iron crystal lattice.  These carbon atoms deform the shape of the crystal, and in doing so increase the energy levels required to move a dislocation, thus making the material far stronger (before carbon addition it is simply iron, after carbon addition it becomes steel).  This is [solid solution strengthening](_URL_0_) and the wikipedia article includes a great picture of how the [lattice is distorted by the tiny carbon atoms](_URL_5_).\\n\\nSo to bring this discussion full circle and to answer your question: just like in the car analogy, once the car is pushed over the hill, it will roll down the other side and accumulate kinetic energy.  This is very similar to the motion of dislocations, as they slide into new positions they are releasing energy in the form of kinetic energy that heats the material.\\n\\nAs to the plastic spork question, this is fundamentally different as plastic is a polymer, which is a material that consists of long chains of atoms all jumbled together like spaghetti.  When you bend the fork, you are pulling the strings apart from eachother (imagine pulling the pile of spaghetti apart).  Once you bend a plastic spoon it tends to stay bent, but Rubber bands are polymer chains that want to be all curled up.  When you let go of the spoon, the polymer chains do not snap back to their curled up/jumbled up positions, but a rubber band does.  Richard Feyman (who has forgotten more things about this subject than I would ever hope to know) explained this far better than me in [his short video](_URL_6_) and the tragic consequences of polymer elasticity when he told congress how the [Challenger exploded due to a cold o-ring](_URL_3_).'],\n",

It made for a good story, but it certainly isn't reality.\",\n",
       "   'I\\'m a fan (or at least reader) of Silver\\'s since some time before the 2008 election. But, post-election hype aside, I wouldn\\'t describe what he does as any kind of science. It\\'s certainly got similarities to how things are modeled scientifically, but it\\'s nowhere as rigorous. (at least from what I\\'ve gleaned of his \\'model\\', the exact specifics of which he hasn\\'t published, to my knowledge)\\n\\nThere\\'s a difference between science and pure _empiricism_. If you measure some data points in the relation between two quantities, you know the relation at those points. If you fit a line or curve to those points, it may or may not work predictively. The only way to find out is to actually measure. In other words, pure empiricism does not tell you anything you don\\'t already know. To actually predict something, you need to base your model on some underlying theory. Which in turn, needs to rely on fewer parameters than you\\'re trying to describe, in order to be useful.\\n\\nThere\\'s an important mathematical truth here: Adding empirically-fit parameters to your curve/model, will _always_ make it fit the existing data better, but it does _not_ necessarily make it more predictive. It can do the exact opposite! \\n\\nFor instance, say you have a few points, related through a linear (straight-line) relationship. There\\'s some error in your measurements, so a straight line (y = bx + a) doesn\\'t fit perfectly. If I add a parameter and an x^2 factor to make it a parabolic curve (y = cx^2 + bx + a), I will _always_ be able to get an equal-or-better fit to my points, since the linear case is just the subset where c=0. But if the relationship is actually linear, the parabolic curve is not going to be more accurate outside of the points that I fitted it to.\\n\\nFor that reason, you have to be very careful in adding parameters to your model. When physicist/mathematician John von Neumann asked about how many empirical parameters were used in a model, and got the answer \"four\", he allegedly stated \"with four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk!\". (Many bored physicists/mathematicians have since spent time on seeing just how accurately they can draw an elephant using only four parameters)\\n\\nHaving a theory is more valuable to science than giving correct-but-empirically-based predictions. For instance, the Ideal Gas Law is not a terribly good real-world predictor of how gases behave. But since it\\'s based on a rigorous and non-empirical physical model, we know the limits of its validity. We know _why_ it fails when it does, and it all tells us something about how gases work. A [virial expansion](_URL_1_) explains much the same properties in a set of empirically-determined parameters. It\\'s quite useful as a way of describing the properties of a gas for engineering applications, but it\\'s ultimately just an empirical curve that doesn\\'t really say anything about how the gas _really_ works.\\n\\nSilver\\'s model is basically empirical. He doesn\\'t have (and AFAIK, doesn\\'t purport to have) an actual model of how people vote and why. The main data is polls, which is as close to a measurement of what you want to know as you can get. Correct predictions on the basis of polling data doesn\\'t contain any more theoretical insight into human voting patterns than the observation that people are more-or-less truthful when asked anonymously about how they intend to vote.\\n\\nThe truly interesting/valuable thing about Silver\\'s model is rather how it aggregates multiple polling results into a more accurate end-result. Measurements have errors and biases (in the statistical, not political, sense), and it\\'s entirely possible to compensate for these things to get a more accurate end-result, if you have sufficient data to do so. This is statistics and measurement theory. Not so much science in-itself, but a tool that science uses. We \"calibrate\" measurements against known results. A poll with more respondents should naturally be given greater weight than one with fewer, the methodology (and its measured or perceived reliability) can be taken into account, systematic biases based on their previous performance etc. It ends up being a lot of parameters, and they\\'re not necessarily very exact, as it\\'d be difficult to actually isolate and determine them. It\\'s a bit ad-hoc, and certainly imprecise. But, it doesn\\'t _have_ to be that precise. The polls do not diverge more than a few percentage points from each other or the actual result. \\n\\nOther data Silver included in his model (and I believe there\\'s been some criticism of that) are less important, and not necessarily warranted. For instance economic indicators such as the unemployment rate. Is it _really_ justified to include that as if it were an independent factor? Isn\\'t the state of the economy _already_ reflected in whole or in part in the polling results? It doesn\\'t seem to me that these additional variables helped Silver\\'s model (the [Princeton](_URL_0_) model didn\\'t include them, and did IMO just as well). Although it doesn\\'t seem they were significant enough to throw the result off. \\n\\nIn short, I think the lesson here is that these aggregate poll models, using state and national results, obviously do a better job than any single poll would. But it\\'s not really any kind of science in-itself. If you find that your watch is consistently 5 minutes ahead of the actual time, and decide to start subtracting 5 minutes every time you look at your watch, it\\'ll probably give you a more accurate value. But it hasn\\'t given you any real ability to predict the time.',\n",

Specifically, rather than maintain the data in 3D, stellar evolution groups simulate a star as a collection of homogeneous spherical shells.\\n\\nFor a long time this was actually the cause of a serious puzzle in astrophysics. When supernova simulations first started, they also treated the star as spherically symmetric, computing on a 1D array, and what they found was that the shockwave lost power before it could leave the core of the star, and no supernova occurred. Upon adding a second and then a third dimension to the simulation they found that asymmetric perturbation built up over time, causing a build up of turbulence and magnetic field growth. This contributed additional energy to the shockwave though (last I heard, not having been in this field for a few years) it didn't solve the problem entirely. The behavior they discovered was exactly this kind of sloshing that the video is talking about.\"],\n",

To try and add on to this, turbulent viscosity -- [i.e. the Boussinesq hypothesis](_URL_0_) -- is really directly analogous to molecular viscosity, the regular fluid-friction idea. As LBM said, molecular viscosity at a particle level is just a diffusion of momentum. Similarly turbulent viscosity is just a diffusion of momentum at a larger (eddy-size) scale, so it should come as no surprise that it results in the same functional form. Just as molecular viscosity is a result of random motion of particles interacting, turbulence is often taken to be an isotropic random process, so the end result is losses of momentum to heat.\\n\\nAt a small-scale level, it might be helpful to think of turbulent losses as being the result of elastic collisions. In inelastic collisions, like perfectly hard spheres bouncing off each other, momentum is conserved and the spheres go off on their own. With truly elastic collisions, some of this momentum is lost to heat energy.',\n",

Actually the protons and neutrons are themselves made up of \"fractionally charged\" particles, quarks, with charge +2/3 (up) or -1/3 (down), but these quarks are always combined in ways that add up to integers.\\n\\nSo fractional charges (quarks) are already known to exist but never be independently observable. It would be interesting if fractional charges that could exist on their own could exist as well, and some models of particle physics beyond the Standard Model predict such charges.\\n\\nb. One way that fractional charges are interesting is that they would (1) get stuck in ordinary matter, since they are electrically charged; (2) be extremely detectable, because no number of integer charges can exactly cancel their charge out. There are various precise ways to measure the \"neutrality of matter\"---that is, making sure that all the + and - charges in matter have cancelled out. If a lump of matter contains a fractional charge then cancellation is impossible (except by antimatter fractional charges---and then they would have already annihilated).

However, the use of language to describe experiences of people is so consistent, that it would be hard to imagine a system of colors, subjective experiences and names where they just weren\\'t the same.

I don\\'t actually answer your question, so don\\'t get too excited. However, I do hint at where the answer might lie. \\n\\nWell, the first thing you should know is that we do not \"see\" anything with the eyes; we see with the [visual cortex](_URL_7_), which is seated towards the back of the skull. \\n\\nTo put it as simply as I understand it, [photoreceptor cells](_URL_7_) convert light into biological signals, and these signals manage to find their way to the visual cortex. The visual cortex processes these signals, and you wind up being able to see.  \\n\\nIf you don\\'t have functioning eyes, your visual cortex doesn\\'t receive any signals to process, and if your visual cortex is not functioning, there isn\\'t anything to process what signals you *do* receive. Both cases result in blindness. \\n\\nThe second thing you should know is how our eyes convert light to biological signals. We do this with two types of photoreceptor cells: [cones](_URL_7_) and [rods](_URL_7_). Cones focus on what colors we see, and rods focus on whether or not there is a change in color. I could go further into the [density of rods and cones on the retina](_URL_7_), but the one you want to be concerned with are the cones. \\n\\nSo, there are three kinds of cones in humans, with each type responding to either the \"red\", \"blue\", or \"green\" wavelengths of visible light, respectively. On average, there are around 4.5 million cones on the retina, with the number of cones per individual varying anywhere from [4.08–5.29 million](_URL_7_). \\n\\nSince individuals DO have significant variance in the number of cones they have (9% less or 17% more than the average), and cones convert light into biological signals, it isn\\'t impossible that the visual cortex of the brain receives more signals about RGB colors as the number on the retina increases, and that more cones might lead to more signals received by the visual cortex of x color. This does NOT necessarily mean we see a \"stronger\" color as the number of signals for a color increases.  \\n\\nThe third thing you should know is that I have absolutely no clue on how the visual cortex processes the signals created by photoreceptors. Remember, we *see* with this part of the brain; our eyes transfer what light they receive into biological signals, and the visual cortex interprets these signals, somehow giving us sight. I have no clue on how the visual cortex process these signals, and as such, I can\\'t give you an answer to your question. \\n\\nI can, however, say that your question is probably asking the following:\\n\\nAre the signals received by the visual cortex translated into different colors for different individuals? Can the same type of signal be seen by one individual as a \"green\", while being seen by another individual as a \"blue\"?\\n\\n**Anyways TL;DR:** Lots of things go on for us to see stuff. \\n\\nOh, as a sidenote, [there is a possibility that some humans can see ultraviolet](_URL_7_), which is kind of crazy.

My concept of green cannot be assigned to a different sensation in another person's mind because the concept is impossible to divorce from perception.\\n\\nIf we could imagine a color that we cannot sense then it would suggest such a thing was even possible, but as far as I know we cannot do so.\",\n",

Those extra days have to go somewhere! And where they were put in has varied across cultures. A popular choice for cultures with lunar calendars was to just kind of ignore them until your calendar was about a month off, and then have an \"intercalary month\" - a month inserted between two regular months (so, these cultures would have 13 months a year every so often).\\n\\nThis eventually became unsatisfying and, through a number of calendar reforms, the Gregorian calendar which we use today was developed in 1582, and eventually spread across the world. However, there are people that still use other calendars in addition to the Gregorian calendar; notably the Jews and the Muslims (which is why their holidays \"drift\" - they are based off lunar calendars; this is also why Easter drifts so much too). The Gregorian calendar is very similar to the Julian calendar (which was decreed for Rome by Julius Caesar starting in 45BC), it mostly just fixes how leap days are inserted.\\n\\n---\\nAs for why weeks are seven days?

[I had an older comment about related phenomena here](_URL_2_) that goes over transient behavior (how sound is created in viscous fluids), but you seem to be asking more about steady-state behavior like a damper or sound being transmitted through a fluid.  \\n\\nBulk viscosity is directly proportional to damping sound.  Higher bulk viscosity means more damping.  Typically this only really applies to gases, since they can lose energy adiabatically.  This is what people talk about when they describe attenuation in fluids, but it's rarely described as damping.  High bulk viscosity usually implies gas-like behavior, which usually implies low dynamic viscosity.\\n\\nNormally viscosity means dynamic/shear viscosity.  This kind of viscosity is essentially absent in plane waves (when the source of vibration is far away), but dominant around point sources.  When adjacent parts of the fluid are moving in different directions you get shear.  That's what happens when sound comes from a point source, since the sound [moves outward, away from all the other sound](_URL_1_).\\n\\nFor sound, shear stress and therefore energy loss to viscosity is proportional to the characteristic acoustic impedance of the fluid.  Acoustic impedance is the ratio of flow to pressure.  Sound/vibrations in general are pressure waves, which push material back and forth, and amount of fluid that moves at a given pressure is the flow.  Normally when you consider sound you'll neglect the fact that fluid particles are actually flowing- it's typically pretty unimportant for bulk vibration transmission.  It does still exist, though, and since there's flow there's an accompanying loss of energy through viscosity.\\n\\nThe thing is... shear viscosity can increase local impedance, and in a highly nonlinear way.  For simple sources and low-medium viscosity, increasing the viscosity will just increase loss. \\nFor very high viscosity fluids the resistance to shear will be so great that it just prevents shear and everything gets very weird and nonlinear.  It's a bit simpler if you've got an orifice or a transducer like a shock absorber, where it depends almost totally on the geometry.  The piston on a shock absorber [has a bunch of small holes](_URL_0_) which increase the area that shear acts on, so in that case it doesn't matter much what the acoustic impedance of the fluid is.  If the viscosity is too high it'll choke those holes and decrease the area for shear to act on, which actually lowers damping.\\n\\nMore often viscosity comes into play for how sound is created.

To understand how and how fast things react with each other you need to take a closer look.\\n\\nSo let's say A can be in two different forms which are in an equilibrium, I call them A1 and A2. Only A2 can react with B, A1 cannot. So now stuff gets more complicated, because we got a reaction like A1 < -eqilibrium- > A2 +B - >  C. This might react in a different way in regards to kinetic order than if we just have one A that reacts with B to C. But in the end the equation looks the same.\\n\\nBut for 0, 1st and 2nd order this is much more simple.\\n\\n2nd order: A + B - >  products\\nSo here A and B needs to meet (in a certain way) to react. If I got more A or more B or more of both the reaction will be faster. Since you got two different concentrations multiplied the concentration will be squared if they are the same(!)\\n\\nFirst order:\\nPrime example: radioactive decay\\nIn this case: A- >  products \\nIf we got starting material A and there is an X% change to react in a certain time you will get an first order reaction. In this case the half-life is independent from the concentration.\\n\\nzero Order:\\nExample here: blood alcohol degradation\\nzero order just means a certain amount reacts in a certain time, concentration doesn't matter.

       "   \"Say you have the reaction A + B -- >  C. The way this reaction occurs is that every now and then due to random thermal motion, A goes into some uncommon higher-energy state A^* , after which A^* rapidly reacts with B to form C. If the latter step is much faster than the former one, the rate at which the overall reaction occurs will depend only on how fast you can produce A^* , which depends only on the concentration of A present. So that is where you have a first-order reaction. \\n\\nA second-order reaction is a situation where A and B would collide and react directly with each other to form C. In that case the probability of a collision would be proportional to both the concentrations of A and B, in which case you have a second-order reaction. You can also have a reaction where A and B are the same molecule, in which the rate is proportional to the concentration A^2.\\n\\nYes, zeroth-order is just as strange as you think it is. Obviously in reality no reaction is _truly_ zeroth order. If there are no reactants at all present, how could you possibly have any reaction?? So when you say 'zeroth order', you really mean in conditions where you have a sufficient amount of reactant molecules present that they no longer act rate-limiting. That is, reactions are _effectively_ zeroth-order but not _truly_ zeroth order, in that they won't be that at _any_ concentration. \\n\\nThe kind of situation where that happens is for instance with a catalyzed reaction where there's an ample supply of reactant molecules. For instance a catalytic converter in a car. In this case,  you have an essentially constant rate of reactant molecules being supplied, so the reaction is not hindered by a lack of reactants, and the limiting factor is the amount of catalyst surface area. So in this case the reaction rate is independent of the concentration, and if the surface area is large enough to not be limiting either, then you simply have a constant reaction rate.

When your blood vessels get damaged they expose the underlying tissue and cells. Platelets, a type of cell in your blood, stick onto this underlying tissue and become \\'stickier\\'; they join onto other platelets more easily. This forms a group of platelets over the wound.\\n\\nAt the same time, there is a cascade of \"Factor\" changes; these are proteins in your blood which go through a series of reactions to convert Prothrombin to Thrombin, which \\'amplifies\\' the cascade by converting factors which are involved at the start, beginning the process all over again. This means that from an initial small amount of protein changes you can very quickly have a large amount of Thrombin being produced. Whilst this cycle can start itself over again it will eventually stop.\\n\\nThrombin converts Fibrinogen into Fibrin which is important for forming a Blood Clot.\\n\\nBlood Clots are formed from the Fibrin and the Platelets, and this blood clot is called a \"thrombus\". They form normally and is what stops you from bleeding out when you get a cut on your skin. \\n\\nSo internally you wouldn\\'t get a scab which would fall off, you would get a \"thrombus\"; it\\'s very similar to a scab but there is not a hard outer layer.\\n\\nIn the body normally, blood clots break down. You\\'ll often get damage to your blood vessels, and blood clots form in response, and then will be broken back down and the cycle repeats whenever you get injured. This is a process called \"Fibrinolysis\", and is again a normal part of the healing process.\\n\\nSo, to sum up, \\'scabs\\' in the body would be Blood Clots that form in response to damage. They don\\'t fall off like external scabs but would be broken down eventually. \\n\\nInterestingly, when blood clots don\\'t break down properly, or form and get dislodged, they can cause health problems such as Pulmonary Embolism, where they get trapped in blood vessels in the lungs, or Strokes, where they get trapped in blood vessels in the brain.

Usually in the form of a net-like structure. This net traps other big bits (i.e., cells) and makes more structure for the clot to grow. Once formed, the netlike structure will start to constrict, squeezing out water and making a semi solid clump....a clot. If this clump is exposed to air, it will dry and make a scab.\\n\\nBut if it's inside, the clot is kind of its own destruction. Once the clotting reaction has been going on for a while, the clotting reaction itself activates enzymes in the blood that chop up that net. However, like most enzymes, these are dependent on water. And if the clot has constricted enough (and it probably has down deep in there somewhere), the enzyme can't get in and do its job.\\n\\nOn the surface, this is fine. The far side dries out, healing kicks in, and the scab falls off. Inside, it's a bit different, and the clot can persist for quite a while. Eventually, water will work its way back in and the clot can be broken down by those enzymes in the blood. But if the damage is still there (the plaque, the pooled blood, etc), the clot will re-form as fast or faster than those enzymes can break it down.\"],\n",

The hallmark of a semiconductor is that once you start adding in the electrons into these energy levels, you will end up with a filled band called the valence band, which is separated by a finite energy (called the band gap) from the next available (and empty) band, called the conduction band as shown [here](_URL_1_).

For instance, since we have 1 = e^(2pi i) = e^(4pi i) = e^(6pi i)=..., then taking logarithms would seem to suggest that 0 = 2pi i = 4pi i = 6pi i =... which obviously isn\\'t the case. The problem arises because you are starting at 1, with log(1)=0, and tracing along e^(it) for t=0 to t=2pi, taking logarithms is fine until we get to 2pi, where we find that e^(2pi i)=1 which means that log(1)=2pi i, but we already know that log(1)=0. Logarithms do not behave well on the complex plane and the key mistake in your derivation is that you\\'re treating the logarithm like a normal logarithm on the reals. A logarithm on the entire complex plane is not a well defined function.\\n\\nThe solution to this is to make it so that that you\\'re not allowed to go in a full circle around 0 in the complex plane. If you pick any ray beginning at 0 and extending out to infinity on the complex plane and declare that the logarithm is undefined on this ray, then you will have a well defined logarithm, as you can\\'t go a full circle around 0 anymore. This is called a \"Branch Cut\". If we choose the ray along the negative imaginary axis, then log(1)=0 and log(-1)=i pi and there\\'s no ambiguity, since you can\\'t increase your angle past 3pi/2.\\n\\nNow, we *can* fix it in a much more appealing way, but it is more abstract. If we start at 1=e^(0i), and trace around the unit circle via e^(it), then we\\'re good until we hit t=2pi. To fix this, we can imagine that instead of tracing around the circle in the complex plane, that we\\'re actually tracing around a spiral that\\'s elevating, like a spiral staircase. [See Here](_URL_0_). By the time you hit t=2pi, you\\'ve gone around one entire time but instead of  being where you started, you\\'re exactly one level above where you started. If you were to flatten the this spiral, then you would be at the starting point, but because it has extended upwards, we are no longer at the same point. In this way, we can keep track of things by what level they are on. For instance, e^(0i) is on the 0th floor, but e^(2pi i) is on the first floor. We can define a logarithm on this spiral by inputting a complex number *and* what floor its on. This would look like log(z,n), where z is a complex number and n is the floor. So log(1,0)=0, log(1,1)=2pi i, log(1,2)=4pi i etc. If you try to cut out an entire floor and flatten it, then you\\'ll end up with the complex plane that has a branch cut at where you cut the floor out.

       "   '> There are two defintions of nothing:\\n > The everyday understanding of nothing, which is literally no-thing.\\n > The scientific understanding of nothing, which is quantum foam.\\n\\nLet\\'s be clear -- the quantum foam isn\\'t \"nothing,\" it\\'s a vacuum, which is different from nothing.  A vacuum *can* have both virtual and real particles in it (usually called a \"condensate\"), and in fact this is how the Higgs mechanism is supposed to work -- a condensate of virtual Higgs bosons permeates space.\\n\\nA vacuum is the lowest energy state that a field can reach (or, a local minimum, in which case it is known as a false vacuum).  If a field\\'s lowest energy state is non-zero, then the field \"has something in it\" at all times.\\n\\nBut the concept of \"nothing\" is the same in science as it is in layman\\'s terms; it\\'s just that a vacuum is not necessarily nothing.  Even a vacuum with zero energy is not \"nothing\" -- it is a field, with nothing in it.\\n\\n > Quantum physics has led us to re-evaluate this. It seems something is inescapable. Nothing1 is impossible, it\\'s an abstract concept, because nothing1 by its own definition can\\'t exist. If nothing1 existed it would be quantifiable, it would be something.\\n\\nThe vacuum is not impossible, although it\\'s certainly an abstract concept.  But a vacuum is not exactly nothing, although it can have nothing in it.\\n\\n > Nothing2 has weight, it also has energy. This energy is what drives the expansion of our universe, and because that energy is believed to be infinite, it explains why it is speeding up rather than slowing down. Not only does it contain energy, it can produce virtual particles that pop into existence and then annihilate each other all the time.\\n\\nThis is really far-reaching here; be careful of overspeculation.\\n\\nA vacuum with something in it, such as the one we understand to be our universe\\'s vacuum (lowest energy state) does have energy, yes.  That energy isn\\'t necessarily what drives the expansion of our universe, however all evidence for dark energy thus far is compatible with such an explaination, usually referred to as a cosmological constant.\\n\\nExactly what contributes to the cosmological constant is still up for debate -- it could be a Higgs condensate, a modification of relativity, a more exotic non-Higgs condensate of some kind, potentially even a combination of these and more possibilities.\\n\\nThat energy is not \"believed to be infinite.\"   Current observations are consistent with a small, finite cosmological constant.  Quantum mechanics predicts a finite cosmological constant, but one that is over a hundred orders of magnitude larger than what is observed, a conundrum known as a \"heirarchy problem.\"\\n\\nThe accelerated expansion of the universe is explained as due to the gravitation of this \"dark energy.\"  Dark energy is shown to have a negative pressure (which is very unusual, but it demonstrates that a volume of vacuum will resist expansion).  Because the pressure is negative, the equation for the gravity it produces is also negative, resulting in a *repulsive* gravity that is stronger than the negative pressure which resists expansion.  The stronger gravity then drives the universe to expand.\\n\\n > But how can these particles come from nothing!? It goes against everything we know to be true in classical physics. It violates the 2nd law of thermodynamics for one thing, since energy cannot be created or destroyed. This is where it gets really interesting.\\n\\nThis is not true.  The particles don\\'t \"come from nothing\" -- particles are just excitations of a field, and the field is always there.  The lowest energy state (vacuum state) of some fields contain a non-negligible condensate of virtual particles.\\n\\nIt also doesn\\'t violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics; no energy is being created or destroyed, the energy is already present in the field.  When a virtual particle annihilates, energy must be conserved, so an annihilation produces new particles, which then go on to annihilate, and so-on.\\n\\n > This spontaneous appearance of virtual particles doesn\\'t violate the law, providing that the energy is paid back very quickly, and when I say quickly I mean in an unimaginably short time span.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t really the best way to describe what\\'s happening.  This description is a result of holding too much onto the concept of a \"particle.\"  What we often percieve as particles are not particles, they are field quanta.  They exhibit some properties of particles and some properties of waves, and quantum mechanics shows that they also exhibit some properties that neither classical particles nor classical waves exhibit.  It is best to describe them as \"field quanta\" rather than particles or waves.\\n\\nA field quantum is, as I understand it, just a non-zero energy state of some field.  If a field is already filled with a condensate of field quanta, they are not \"borrowing\" and \"paying back\" energy; they are just there, the energy contained within is just changing forms as quanta annihiliate and are reproduced again in pairs.  The only notable thing is that the excitations (quanta) do not exist long enough to be measured, so they can\\'t be measured individually; because they can\\'t be measured individually, we call them \"virtual\" particles, even though we *are* able to measure the subtle effects of the condensate of virtual particles as a whole.  There is no technical difference between a real and a virutal particle; it is a matter of convention that we call short-lived field quanta \"virtual\" and long-lived ones \"real.\"\\n\\n > All the matter in the universe acts as positive energy (1). The gravity of all this matter pulling at every other piece of matter acts as a negative counter balance (-1). These two types of energy cancel each other out. Now here is where you\\'re mind should rightfully get blown. Despite it being epic and mind boggling, the mathematics for it is crazily simple:\\n > 1 + -1 = 0\\n > A good analogy for this was used in Prof. Brian Cox\\'s Wonders of the Universe. Imagine you a digging a hole. You toss the dirt into a pile right next to it. The pile essentially represents the positive energy of matter, where as the vacuum, the hole, represents the negative energy of gravity. As we travel back in time we can imagine tossing dirt back into the hole. As we add more and more the universe gets more and more condense until you hit the pinnacle; 1 Planck Length after the Big Bang (the Planck Epoch). Once the hole is filled it is neither a pile or a hole, it is flat land. This flat land represents the mutual cancellation of the two energies.\\n\\nYou must also be careful here -- again this is only speculation, and it is not known for certain whether gravitational potential energy exactly cancels the rest energy of matter, or what.  There are some elegant theories based on this idea, and I\\'m not saying they\\'re right or wrong, just that the hypothesis is not yet testable, as we lack the proper theory for describing gravity on small scales or at high energies.\\n\\n > As for the Big Bang, as a bonus mind-fuck for you, we cannot get past the Planck Epoch. The science seems to indicate that the universe was already 1 Planck unit old when the Big Bang occured!\\n\\nYou\\'re jumping to conclusions here.  Currently our understanding of physics breaks down at the Planck scale.  That does *not* mean that the universe must have already been 1 Planck unit old when the Big Bang occurred, and that is not even possible considering the beginning of the Big Bang is, by definition, \"time zero.\"\\n\\nWhat is really happening is, our current theories of physics are not able to make any predictions or say anything meaningful about durations of less than 1 Planck time; therefore, what happened within that first unit of duration cannot in principle be known unless there is a more fundamental theory that more properly describes the behaviour of the universe in these small intervals.  Since no theory yet proposed is able to make any predictions, we are reduced to mere speculating about the beginning of the Big Bang, which is more philosophy than science.'],\n",

Pure capacitance will make the current go to -90 degrees, or 90 degrees lead, or current ahead of the voltage by a quarter cycle. Pure inductance will make it go to 90 degrees, or 90 degrees lag, or behind by a quarter cycle. \\n\\n\\nSo if the current is from -90 to 0 degrees, you have a leading (capacitive load) with power going forwards. If from 0 to 90 degrees you have a lagging (inductive) load with power going forwards. 90 to 180 degrees you have the flip (+180) of -90 to 0, so leading load with power going backwards. -90 to -180 degrees you have lagging load with power going backwards. 90 or -90 degrees you have no power flowing either way, just reactive power cycling back and forth.\"],\n",

If you go straight out from the center of the slit, consider all the waves you\\'d get from each point: the waves from the center of the slit reach you first, followed shortly by the waves from the edges. If the difference in those two travel times is low enough, you\\'ll get all the waves arriving at the same point in their cycle and adding constructively. So the wave keeps traveling perpendicular to the slit without much trouble. \\n\\nBut with your point off to the side, things are different. Each point from the slit is still contributing, but now instead of being roughly equidistant to the point in question, there are a range of phases contributing (since each wave took a different amount of time to arrive despite being in phase with each other initially). If there\\'s enough difference (if the period of the wave is short enough to be comparable to the difference in travel time), then there will be waves which are at opposite points in their cycles and canceling each other out, leaving a shadow of low amplitude. You can also see that the shadowing effect depends on both the wavelength and the width of the slit, because the wavelength determines the wave period and the width of the slit determines how different the travel times will be. \\n\\nThanks for prompting me to think about this, I actually found out why the wavelength hitting a slit matters, in terms of Huygen\\'s principle :)\\n\\nRegarding the travel direction of the waves, it\\'s a bit subtle. The waves obey the [wave equation](_URL_0_), which basically says that the vertical acceleration of any point on the lake is proportional to the curvature (second derivative) at that point (with water in a lake you can think of this as low points being filled in and high points dropping). Every solution of this equation happens to be the sum of an outgoing and incoming wave for each point on the lake. Also, the sum of any two waves which are solutions to the equation produce another solution, which is why waves can be superposed without bumping into each other (and this is the basis of Huygen\\'s principle) When you consider a point to be a \"source\" (for the purposes of the Huygens principle), all you\\'re doing is specifying the amplitude of that point at that instant. \\n\\nWhat happens to the incoming waves at that instant? They actually pass through that point and become outgoing waves. the outgoing waves keep spreading until they hit some kind of boundary that doesn\\'t follow the wave equation. [This gif](_URL_1_) shows a traveling wave. Knowing the rule for acceleration of each point, you can work out why each point behaves as it does (I\\'ll describe the right-moving wave). On the front end of the wave, there is some positive curvature (curving upwards away from the point) and so that point is accelerated upward (the next moment this creates more curvature for the point to its right). A ways up there is a point where the wave goes from being curved up to being curved down. This is the point where there is no acceleration and the point has reached its maximum upward speed. At the top, the curvature is negative and the point slows down and turns back around. As it nears the edge the positive curvature pushes up again, slowing it down, until it reaches zero once again and the wave has passed. This illustrates how a wave travels in obedience of the wave equation, and why it doesn\\'t change direction until it hits something.'],\n",

[Source](_URL_0_).\\n\\n(**Warning**: Stream-of-consciousness math ahead)\\n\\n[This](_URL_2_) source lists the LD50 for coumadin in cattle at 200 mg/kg/day for 5 days. [this site] (_URL_1_) has an average cow weighing about 1500 lbs, or about 680 Kg (rounding to whole numbers). So, 200 mg/kg at 680 kg = 13600 mg, or 136g over 5 days, which works out to about 27g per day. I searched around to get a figure for how much a cow generally eats per day, and while none of them are particularly scholastic, they *all* refer to a figure of about 2% of body weight per day, which will be good enough for illustrative purposes. So, 2% of 680 = 13.6 Kg. The coumadin content needs to be about 0.20% by mass of daily food intake for 5 days to hit the Ld50. That's a pretty small amount, but remember that for the microbes that produce the compound to really thrive, they need a warm, damp environment. Well-dried hay shouldn't be a problem, but hay cut and left on the ground could be an issue while it dries (hence, the avoiding of fresh-cut grass).\\n\\nNow, on to how it kills: From the first source above, coumadin is highly water soluble, and readily bioavailable. So it can easily be dissolved and used by the body. Since the clotting mechanism is so similar between the three species discussed (cows, rats, humans) I'm going to make the assumption that they'll be affected by a given concentration (mg drug/Kg body weight) in a similar manner. Coumadin starts taking effect within 24 hours, but can take 3-5 days for the full effect to be realized. [source](_URL_3_). This is for therapeutic dosages, for the kind of dose you'd find in rat poison, it would act much quicker, my guess would be inside of 2 days, possibly as fast as one day. \\n\\nThe lethal action doesn't really require what you would typically think of as an injury. Various things like microtraumas, inflammation, or hypertension can contribute to blood  'leaking'. Normally, these are rapidly patched up by the clotting cascade, but with the K cycle suppressed (to an extent that is again, dose-dependent) that can't happen as effectively. In overdoses, you can rapidly find bleeding of the gums/GI tract without apparently visible injury. Even more dangerous are bleeds in the brain, that can rapidly increase intracranial pressure.\"],\n",

       "  'text': ['There actually are many common fuels - in fact gasoline is one of them - that burn more easily at lower temperatures than higher temperatures, but we have to be a bit more precise about what we mean by \"burns more easily\" and \"low temperatures\". \\n\\nIn combustions science, we characterize how easily a mixture burns at a given temperature using the *ignition delay time*. Basically the idea is that you mix your fuel with air, then you heat it up to the desired temperature, then you wait until it spontaneously combusts. Short delay times between when you reach the desired temperature and when the mixture combusts (indicated usually by a large rapid increase in temperature or pressure in your container) indicates that the mixture burns more easily. For a simple fuel like hydrogen, if the mixture starts out at 300K (room temp) combustion will essentially never be initiated and the ignition delay time is infinite. If you heat the mixture up to 700K or so, then it will ignite in a few milliseconds. As you go to higher and higher temperatures, the ignition delay time always decreases. This is the trend you would expect - your fuel burns more easily at higher temperatures.\\n\\nThe interesting situation where this becomes relevant to your question is for large hydrocarbon fuels like gasoline. For these fuels, at 300K again the fuel will never ignite. Around 600K ignition takes a ~1 millisecond. Around 1000K ignition takes maybe 10 milliseconds. Then at temperatures greater than 1000K ignition rapidly speeds up and can take less than 1 millisecond. So we see at \"low\" temperatures (700K, warmer than temperature of your oven) the fuel is more reactive than at mid-range temperatures (1000K), but not as reactive as at high temperatures (1300-2000K). \\n\\nThis phenomenon is known in combustion as low temperature chemistry and is actually of critical importance in every day life - [engine knock](_URL_0_) in gasoline automobile engines is caused when the fuel in the engine ignites before the spark plug goes off due to low temperature chemistry. Therefore, we actually want to burn gasoline that minimizes the importance of low temperature chemistry, which is why gas used to be leaded and is now diluted slightly with ethanol.\\n\\nI haven\\'t yet mentioned the cause of this interesting behavior where cooler mixtures burn more rapidly than warmer ones because it is actually quite complicated. In short, there are two different chemical reaction pathways by combustion can occur. One is only possible for large fuel molecules and occurs between 600-900K. The other is possible for all fuels (and is typically the dominant pathway) but requires higher temperatures of  > 1000K. In between, reaction is slower because neither pathway is at its maximum.',\n",
       "   'If you want to restrict your search to exothermic oxidation (burning reactions) then, from the Gibbs energy change, the change in entropy for the reaction must be negative. Do note that just because the entropy is decreasing locally within the system (the formation of the reaction products) this does not violate the second law. One example is the burning of methane (!?). This example sounds counter intuitive: why is the burning of methane \"easier\" at lower temperatures? We don\\'t notice this temperature dependence for two reasons.\\n\\nThe change in entropy is so small that any temperature dependence of the Gibbs free energy is small. But more importantly we\\'ve been ignoring kinetics. At higher temperatures the rates of nearly (but interestingly not all) reactions increases. This is due to the existence of reaction activation barriers. The molecules now require an energy above a certain amount before they can react. At higher temperatures molecules have greater amounts of energy and are thus able to overcome this barrier. Therefore, it would seem that at higher temperatures methane is more readily combustible. In the kinetic sense it very much is and this overpowers any lessening of the feasibility of reaction due to small entropy changes. Vice versa for lower temperatures.\\n\\nAs for other examples of this type, combustion of hydrogen is one. While generally there are plenty of example reactions with an decrease in entropy, common combustion is more difficult. The decease in entropy for the combustion of methane or hydrogen is due to the reactants, gaseous methane or hydrogen and oxygen, having quite a high entropy to start with. Other common fuels aren\\'t gaseous (alcohol, propane, gasoline etc.). It would have to be a burning reaction which produces a solid product, maybe (thermite maybe, but I couldn\\'t find data). In the end though, kinetics will always win and any temperature dependence will be drowned out by the increased rates of reaction at higher temperatures.\\n\\nEdit: grammar'],\n",

       "  'text': [\"[There are at least twelve distinct hypotheses as to how and why bipedalism evolved in humans.](_URL_1_) This is all from the linked article. Bipedalism allows for a greater field of vision and improves detection of distant resources or threats, allows for wading into deeper water and reaching higher food sources. It also leaves the arms free for non-locomotion uses such as carrying infants, food, tools and weapons. The ability to carry meat/food over considerable distances and the ability to carry infants are both considered major driving forces in original bipedalism. The most simple viable theory is the Thermoregulatory model: bipedalism raises the body surface area higher above the ground reducing heat gain and aids heat dissipation due to increased exposure to favorable wind speeds and temperatures. It also reduces direct exposure to the sun than quadrupeds. \\n\\nIn terms of respiration while running, the bones and muscles of a quadruped's chest cavity act as shock absorbers and also expand and contract continuously, limiting them to a 1:1 strides per breath ratio. This forces them to coordinate respiration with running gait resulting in a specific running speed being most energy efficient. Bipeds don't experience this direct chest compression during running, allowing them to vary their breathing patterns (4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 5:2 etc). This is all part of the [Endurance running hypothesis](_URL_0_). So bipedalism is actually more energetically favorable, especially in terms of scavenging. Endurance running allows for more effective long range strategic scavenging, such as seeing birds circling overhead and running directly to the carcass, rather than relying solely on opportunistic scavenging or just stumbling upon a carcass. Bipeds can spot the long range cues and run directly to a carcass, reaching it before competitors like lions, hyenas etc. that are much stronger and thus harder to drive away.  \\n\\nLong story short, there are numerous supported theories on human bipedal evolution and they're not necessarily mutually exclusive, any number of reasons could have acted together forcing bipedal evolution. Also the theories state that adaptations for running clearly came after bipedalism and metabolic rate is fairly similar between quadrupeds and bipeds so energy efficiency wouldn't have driven original biped evolution.  Endurance running may be more energy efficient but walking on two legs doesn't conserve enough energy to drive the numerous muscular and neurological changes required to stand and walk bipedally. \\n\\nEdit: Spelling\",\n",

This cause the forest to recede leaving open savanna between to forested areas. It is likely that the seeds of bipedalism were already there given the probable method of arboreal locomotion of the hominin where we used a modified brachiation in which hand-over-hand motion was supported by feet on lower branches(like orangutans). This gave them a favorable hip morphology that allowed for a more efficient bipedal locomotion (as opposed to that of something like a chimpanzee). This bipedal locomotion was selected for because of its energy efficiency, and the ability to carry offspring and other things (food, tools, etc).'],\n",

       "  'text': ['This is my area of expertise, but unfortunately I am not familiar with this specific nematode. Unfortunately, I doubt that this has anything to do with brain control. For one, many worms use gastropods as intermediate hosts, and they often infect their reproductive tissues, not their brains so they may parasitize the gastropods without killing them immediately, which would interrupt their asexual proliferation phase. As for the ungulates having their brain tissue infected, this is most likely by mistake, it seems to properly complete their life cycle they must reach the digestive tract. Larvae that reach the brain tissue and hatch there seem to be the ones causing this pathology, but they cant exit the body to reproduce, so there doesnt seem to be a selective advantage for it. I would guess that the neural pathology must work slow, or the parasite life cycle must be fast for this species interaction, as the pathology associated with it seems quite severe, much different than the behavioral modification seen with Toxoplasma infection. \\n\\nWhat intrigues me is the the gastropods are ingested for infection to occur--which is almost never the norm. Many larval stage worms that use a snail intermediate are perfectly good at penetrating mammalian skin, and would not rely on their intermediate host being ingested. \\n\\nHowever, if there *was* behavioral modification in the ungulates, it might preference for damper, humid areas, as that is where the larvae will most likely come into contact with gastropods. I can\\'t say definitively that they don\\'t use \"mind control\" but there might be a less complicated explanation, though it is plausible. I am going to run this by my colleagues tomorrow to see if they are familiar with this organism, and will update you with what I hear.\\n\\nEdit: No one was really familiar with this parasite, but it seems like what I said is accurate.

The larvae of P. tenuis \"occasionally\" hatches in the brain however the larvae migrate out which makes behavioral change unlikely. \\nAdditionally, it would not be to the worms advantage for the deer to die because the life cycle requires the larvae to be passed through the feces. Ideally the deer would live as long as possible(or as long as the adult worm is alive and can lay eggs)\\n\\nThe cause of the \"madness\" in moose is likely due to similar situations seen with other parasitic worms. Off-target but similar hosts of these worms often experience adverse symptoms not found in the intended host. The larvae of these worms can get \"lost\" because of a lack of the appropriate biological markers that allow them to navigate the host properly.\\n\\nEdit: I would hypothesize that those worm larvae that occasionally hatch in the brains of moose are unable to migrate out due to the above scenario and just stay in the brain moving around and causing damage and/or inflammation which results in the madness symptoms.\\n\\nFor example- If pork tapeworm(Taenia Solium) eggs (the stage excreted in human feces) are ingested by the intended pig host, the larvae harmlessly encyst in muscle until the meat is ingested by a human. If a human ingests the egg stage(from human feces), the larvae get \"lost\" and can end up encysting in brain tissue which causes neurocysticercosis (seizures and other neorological symptoms or death).',\n",

       "  'text': ['No, there are no political issues with it being a controlled substance. There are plenty of controlled substances that are routinely used in medicine (most anesthetics for starters). It\\'s not much of a barrier to scientific research either. You do need a permit, but that\\'s not usually a problem for any serious, well-thought-out research done by a reputable person/institution. (If it\\'s not, you\\'d be unlikely to get funding for it anyway) \\n\\nI don\\'t know the circumstances of why Strassman\\'s study was \"shut down\", but wouldn\\'t be simply because he was studying a controlled substance. Maybe he didn\\'t have a permit, maybe he was refused one because his research simply wasn\\'t deemed good enough. Or maybe he was refused funding for that or some other reason, and chose to self-servingly interpret it as a \"political\" move rather than accept that others might not have seen the same potential in his work that he did. \\n\\nThere\\'s any number of reasons that are a lot more plausible than DMT being a scheduled substance. Because that\\'s not really a problem. If you actually look, you\\'ll also find [lots of recent papers](_URL_1_) studying DMT in various ways.\\n\\nSo it\\'s being studied. The question is: What is it you think should be studied, how, and why? I\\'m pretty sure that despite what the article says, it hasn\\'t been \"proven in scientifically-documented, placebo controlled research studies to transport human beings out of their current physical and mental state into what can only be described as an alternate plain of existence\", unless you mean that yes, it\\'s a psychedelic drug. [Wikipedia tells me](_URL_0_) that Dr Strassman apparently has some wild conjectures on the substance and it\\'s role, ones that don\\'t have any supporting evidence or mainstream support. \\n\\nSo if you\\'re asking why the \"scientific community at large\" don\\'t study this thing more, then that\\'s your answer: Because there\\'s no evidence of these speculative theories, and because most of those who do study these things don\\'t believe it\\'s true. It\\'s good that you care about schizophrenia - I assure you the people studying it full-time do as well! But the fact that you apparently appreciate it as a recreational drug isn\\'t an argument for why these researchers should drop what they consider to be more fruitful avenues of research and focus on that. Having written a popular book on the topic isn\\'t either. People can write anything they want in a book, they can speculate freely, distort the facts, and present their wildest ideas free of criticism or dissent. So it should be taken with a large amount of salt. \\n\\nIt\\'s not at all difficult for an expert (in anything) to convince a layperson about almost anything in that area, since they simply lack the knowledge to dispute it. As long as it _sounds_ plausible, you\\'ll believe it. _Especially_ if the expert is telling you something you want to hear. You don\\'t even need to know what you\\'re talking about if you\\'re able to convince the person that you are: That\\'s how frauds, quacks, snake-oil salesmen and all kinds of pseudoscience stay in business.\\n\\nSo that\\'s why laypeople don\\'t get to decide what scientists do or who gets funding. By-and-large, the system works and things that (are generally believed to be) the most promising research ideas are the ones that get support and funding. It\\'s naturally not foolproof - we can\\'t predict the future, we can only act to the best of our current knowledge. Bad decisions certainly happen, but they\\'re seldom caused by petty things like \"Oh, that\\'s a recreational drug, and drugs are bad\". I don\\'t know any scientist who\\'d turn down a potentially big discovery, in particular not for that reason. Mostly, bad decisions are caused by, well, stuff like this: Because you have someone who\\'s much better at _selling_ his/her ideas than the ideas would merit, given a level-headed assessment. Because they have a theory that people would _like_ to believe is true. Because they over-exaggerate the importance of what they\\'re doing and it\\'s relevance, and get people caught up in flights-of-fancy. In short, because scientists are human beings too, and as such are susceptible to the same cognitive biases as everyone else. They\\'re just more aware of it, and therefore manage to avoid falling for it as often. A good scientist typically tries to be _more_ skeptical of something if they know they\\'d like it to be true, since our natural impulse is to do the opposite.\\n\\nOf course, as far as neurochemistry or what-have-you is concerned, I\\'m more or less a layperson as well. You shouldn\\'t trust _my_ opinion on whether or not DMT is worthy of more study. I don\\'t actually hold an opinion on that, though. What I _do_ have, is a _trust_ that the people who _are_ experts, who\\'ve spent years and years, full-time, studying this and related things, and who _are_ in a position to properly assess whatever potential you think DMT might have, are entirely capable of doing so, and aren\\'t being prejudiced by irrelevant things like the fact that its\\' a recreational drug. I suppose I have that trust because I\\'ve spent a similar amount of time acquiring as similar amount of expertise in my own field. So I know how little I actually once knew compared to what I know now, and it gives me an idea of how little I must know about _their_ stuff. \\n\\nNaturally, you\\'re free to study the subject, acquire the same level of expertise, and make your own assessment. But the odds are you\\'ll come to the same opinions on Dr Strassman\\'s ideas as the current majority does. Can\\'t the majority be wrong? Of course! But that doesn\\'t mean the opinion of a random layperson should be given equal weight. If you\\'re getting surgery, would you want the treatment most doctors recommend, or would you rather listen to the opinion of a guy on the street who was enticed by a flashy commercial?\\n\\nTL;DR: DMT _is_ studied.

Studying QFTs in finite volumes usually yields some calculable dependence on the boundaries (after regularizing short-distance divergences of course). \\n\\nActually, we should expect the vacuum energy in our universe to be connected to the cosmological constant, but all attempts at making a connection to the measured value have failed miserably (besides a certain \"anthropic\" calculation by Weinberg which even he considers unsatisfactory). But computing the energy difference for two finite volumes, E(V1) - E(V2), should subtract any \"infinite volume\" contribution.\\n\\nEDIT: And just to make clear, this explanation is equivalent to the van der Waals explanation. The alpha = infinity limit is where the conductivity is perfect and the plates\\' van der Waals forces effectively create the boundary condition that the photon field vanishes at the plates. Hence, the alpha = infinity relativistic van der Waals is the same as the QFT + boundary conditions.'],\n",

Presumably you can derive it as a particular limit of the equations of fluid mechanics, but I'm not aware of the details. However, it's possible to guess the form by an intuitive argument: the drag force can be thought to be caused by getting transferred momentum from collisions with fluid particles (recall that force is the rate of change of momentum). Clearly this force should be proportional to surface area (because you hit more particles). It should also increase with velocity, since at higher velocities that particles collide with you at higher relative momentum. But, not only is the momentum transfer increasing at higher velocities, but you should also be hitting more particles per second at higher velocities. Since we expect both the momentum transfer from an individual particle and the number of particles per second to be proportional to velocity, the total force should be proportional to velocity squared.\\n\\nThere is an more sophisticated argument using dimensional analysis which you can find [on wikipedia](_URL_0_).

Can I still watch the light bounce around for a meaningful amount of time at the timescales humans experience?\"  Assume that the light doesn\\'t contact the mirrored surface at weird angles, and that we\\'re using some sort of enhanced aluminum for our mirror (we reflect 99.9% of received light at all wavelengths, which is a fantasy).\\n\\nAfter only 106 reflections, we\\'re at 90% of the initial energy of the beam.  After 700 reflections, we\\'re under 50%.  After 4650 reflections, we\\'re around 1%.  After 10,000 reflections, we\\'re left with like a percent of a percent of the initial energy.  This is assuming nearly perfect reflective qualities which no real material will have, so certainly a real mirrored box will fare worse.\\n\\nIf the box is one meter on each side, then we\\'re looking at 1/3 of 1% of 1% of a single second for this entire process to take place.  That\\'s no time at all.  For 10,000 reflections to last just a second, we\\'d need a box about 30km per side (assuming that atmosphere itself doesn\\'t absorb light, which it does).\\n\\nSome of this energy is going to be re-emitted as radiation.  The surface emissivity of aluminum (and, in general, reflective materials) is very low, so please let me consider this quantity as negligible.  I think only a few percentage points of absorbed energy will be radiated back into the box (maybe less, if you consider radiation lost to the outside environment).\\n\\nOkay, so that was what would happen in real life.  What would happen if the lining of the box was perfectly reflective?  Then it would continue to bounce around forever, right?  Well, maybe not!  Set your box on a frictionless surface.  Inject your perfectly-mirrored box with a shaft of light heading right.  The shaft will hit the box on the rightmost face, transferring a minute amount of momentum to the box.  The box will start moving rightward and the light will become red-shifted.  Then the light will move to the left, hitting the face of the now non-stationary box and blue-shift to the original frequency as the box comes to a stop.  What you will see, if you used a microscope, is the box slowly edging to the right as it exchanges momentum with the light.\\n\\n(fact check!  If we stop here, assume the box is floating in space in a vacuum, and perform the above experiment, we might think that the box could just move along forever as some sort of solar sail--is this even possible in our fantasy experiment?)\\n\\nGreat, so now what?  Assuming that the box is still under the effect of outside forces, you\\'d expect the atmosphere, other photons, whatever, to interact with the box (hey, I assumed it\\'s on a frictionless surface, did you want me to also assume that it\\'s in a perfectly dark vacuum?!).

The color of distant objects are also shifted toward the blue end of the spectrum (e.g., distant mountains).

Keep in mind that the technique is being used in a hospital on a sedentary/sedated patient so the oxygen needs for that individual are extremely low. The technique in the article would be extremely ineffective for providing sufficient oxidation of the blood to perform an activity like swimming.\\n\\nThat being said, say this technique *could* provide enough oxygen to the body. The way the body works, CO2 is moved to the lungs where it diffuses out. However, you need to exhale for the passive diffusion of CO2 to be effective at all. This means that you need to exhale. But then for the lung to reinflate so that you can exhale again, you need to inhale. Essentially, just this technique by itself would be absolutely ineffectual for diving.\\n\\nThere is a way around the acidosis and that is via a extracorporeal CO2 removal machine. It works by taking blood out of your body, removing CO2, and putting the blood back in. However, again, this is something that's used in a hospital for sedentary patients, so it would not be able to remove sufficient CO2 during any activity.\\n\\nThe resulting acidosis (last part of your question) would be extremely dangerous. In this it would be called acute respiratory acidosis. Your body is only able to buffer (i.e. control the acidity of your blood) your blood very slightly and only after several minutes. The resulting acidity, especially after 30 minutes, would cause shock, and respiratory along with other organ failure.\",\n",
       "   'A rough guide to the rise in pCO2 (partial pressure of CO2) is 6 mmHg for the first minute and 3 mmHg for each additional minute of apnea.  So for 30 minutes of apnea: pCO2 = 40 (normal) + 6 + 29*3 = 133 mmHg, which is not compatible with life (at least, I have never seen someone survive that, it would put your pH around 6.7).  However, one could survive 15 minutes, where pCO2 would be 88 mmHg, although this is still very high (pH about 7.0).\\n\\nOne medical use I see for such an innovation would be as a rescue technique for unexpected difficult airway management after induction of anesthesia.  In a situation where one is unable to ventilate or intubate a patient, one only has a few minutes to find a way to deliver oxygen prior to permanent neurological injury or death.  This could buy you enough time for the anesthetic to wear off, in some cases.\\n\\nedit: another idea could be to use such particles in some cases of respiratory failure (eg. ARDS), in combination with mechanical ventilation, to facilitate \"lung-protective\" ventilation strategies that aim to reduce the ventilator\\'s driving pressure.',\n",

I think the simple explanation is if the Earth were to go through a Doomsday scenario, hence 'Doomsday Vault', the first thing humans would need to do is to produce food. The best way to do this is through simply growing it, since we can essentially get all nutrients from vegetation/fruits; carbs (fruits), protein (nuts), fats (avocadoes), and so forth. Plus, to raise cattle you need grass and such to increase food overall, but essentially it all comes down to growing it in our backyards and or underground. But, I do know there are massive storages for embryos in Beijing, China; simply in the case of a mass epidemic (since most flus and such arise in China first and then spread West) that really damages the human race. For coral and keystone species I don't think so, simply because coral and some sea species are EXTREMELY hard to keep in a tank- a reason why a lot of aquariums don't actually have massive amounts of corals to show off to customers. Once they're put into water tanks, any changes in ph (another reason why they're dying off in the coral reefs because of CO2 going into the sea water and lowering the ph) will kill them - they are very very sensitive to sea level ph and chemicals. Side note - along the same lines we can't have Great Whites in aquariums, they die within a few weeks for reasons unknown. So overall, its really easy to store seeds, since the seeds themselves are durable and long lasting (some cases can last decades within hot climates) and also the basis for any food productions across most civilizations in the world.

Lets suppose you have full creation power but your creation is limited to some things. \\n\\nFirst, *the environment*, think about it: if your predator is going to live in a jungle, being rapid isn't the best approach because you can't run in a place full or huge trees, plants going everywhere, uneven terrain and such; but, if your predator is living in the meadow, where you have open and even terrain, you can bet on running strategies.\\n\\nSecond, *the prey itself*. This goes for the size of the prey, the quantity of them, how they defend themselves, etc. Birds can fly to runaway, gazelles are extremely fast (in any documental you can see them mocking of a cheetah! they are jumping around and going even more fast than a full speed cheetah). \\n\\nThird, *what are you getting from your prey?*. This goes in the sense of the nutritious value of your prey. It it very nutritious and you can eat only eat per week? Do you have to eat several of them because they have low nutritious value?\\n\\nLets take a look at some predators.\\n\\nCheetahs are very fast and somehow sneaky. They get as close as they can to the prey and then go on full sprint. If you have seen documentaries, when the cheetah is very close, but detected, and gazelles run, they don't even follow them, because they know they don't have advantage if they are spotted. Only if they get very close and they start the pursuit, they go for it. This is our get-close-and-run case, also, consider cheetahs do this alone, they always go one on one.\\n\\nTake a look at lions. They work in group, so they may have a different strategy. And they do. They also try to get as close as they can, but only a few members. The others are waiting in some key points to keep on the pursuit. They detect a victim, maybe a young and not so fast gazelle, maybe an old or injured one that can't runaway. When they start the pursuit, the first line goes for the kill, if they miss, the second line comes in. If you work in group, the game is bigger, because you can now kill bigger creatures and because you have more mouths to feed.\\n\\nNext case, a very good one. Hyenas. They also work in group. But usually they don't make the pursuit, they steal the game. When a cheetah or lion group has captured a prey, hyenas have been following them through the pursuit and they approach in group to the predator, intimidate it and take the prey as their own. This is an excellent strategy, you don't have to pursuit the prey, you only have to approach in a large and intimidating group to another one's game.\\n\\nNext case. Tigers. This is the jungle example. You can't run in the jungle. You must be sneaky. If you are looking for a prey standing some meters beyond your reach, you have to approach very slowly, trying not to perturb it by making the slightest sound that makes them feel suspicious about their surroundings. This ambush strategy works great in environments like this.\\n\\nFinal case. Wolves. This is where we have an example of what you are asking. Wolves hunt in packs. There may be up to 15 wolves hunting the same prey or group of prey. And they have the strategy you mentioned. Wolves don't attack directly. They don't ambush. They don't steal another one's game. They pursuit the prey for a long time, long distances and they are harassing the prey in the whole process. They have an excellent condition for this type of hunting. Cheetahs have very low fat percentage, so they can't sprint long distances. Lions aren't very fast. Tigers have to ambush. But wolves, they have an acceptable speed, they can resist long pursuits. While the prey is running away, they take turns to close the road, bite the legs, pursuit, try to give the final blow. It usually ends in a very wounded and tired prey that falls to the ground because it can't take it anymore.\\n\\nAbout your second question: they usually chase longer if it is worthy. If you chase for too long, you may be losing more energy than you can afford in this chase. If you chase too short, you threw away energy and didn't get anything for compensation. This are called trade-offs and are related with game theory: how much am I going to bet? how much can I win? Is there any strategy that is better than the other ones?\"],\n",

       "  'text': [\"The heart's muscular structure can adapt to physical demand, it is called adaptive cardiac hypertrophy.  However, this can be both good and bad, depending on which parts of the heart are adapting and growing.  Physiological hypertrophy is considered a healthy response to exercise, and can be noted in athletes as 'athlete's heart,' distinguished by a slightly thicker myocardium around the left ventricle. Pathological hypertrophy is unhealthy, however, and can be resultant of a number of complications such as high blood pressure or heart attacks.  The difference is in how the heart changes in size.  Pathological hypertrophy is characterized by 'scar tissue' building up in poor response to compensate poor blood-flow, which over time further strains and weakens the heart.  With athlete's heart, or physiological hypertrophy, the myocardium thickens as to maximize the utilization of the left and right ventricles to pump blood where it needs to go.  The difference is that in athletes, the ventricles (openings) get larger in addition to the muscle walls getting thicker and stronger.  Whereas with bad hypertrophy, the muscle walls get thicker and the ventricles get smaller, decreasing blood capacity.  \\n\\n\\nThe most digestible reading I could find on this is from a study conducted by the Massachusetts General Hospital a little while ago, published by Harvard on their [website](_URL_0_).\\n\\n\\nIf you're up for the reading, this [article](_URL_2_) though old (2003), does a good job of explaining physiological and pathological hypertrophy, and explores the relationships between the two.  \\n\\n\\nAs for the reason your heart doesn't normally feel so 'sore,' this is due to that it is comprised of a different kind of muscle than your regular skeletal muscles, and operates involuntarily thanks to the syncing of your natural pacemaker, the sinoatrial node.  Physically, your skeletal muscle typically has around ~1-2% composition of mitochondria (think of them as energy factories), whilst your striated heart muscles have something between ~20-30%.  This increased buffering capacity for energy in the muscle gives the heart's muscle more juice so to speak, so it doesn't tire. In addition, your heart's muscles spend most of their time relaxing, with only about 1/3 of the heart beat cycle being a contraction. This is all carefully balanced to maximize the heart's utility thanks to the sinoatrial node. The heart's muscle also has a direct blood supply thanks to the coronary arteries (it doesn't get it's oxygenated blood from absorption in the ventricles, as many people wrongly assume).  This combination of specialized arteries, natural pacemaker, and increased energy capacity, yields a specialized muscle that operates without tiring at a nearly perfect level of synchronization.  Really, a marvel of nature.\\n\\n\\nYou can find info on the physiology of the heart just about anywhere.  This short [summary](_URL_1_) by Eric Rosenberger, MD, does a good job of laying it out.  Any good anatomy/physiology book with a dedicated muscular chapter should be helpful.\\n\\n\\ntl;dr - The heart can build muscle similar to the skeletal muscles of your arms/legs, but doesn't get sore or tire due to the molecular structure (more mitochondria), and specialized physiology (pacemaker, arterial supply).  This is oversimplifying it a bit, however.\\n\\n\\nI'm a pre-medical student with a fondness for the heart.\\nAs usual, if anyone could speak moreso to this, or correct me on something I've misspoken for, please do so!\\n\\nEDIT: Fixed a couple of silly grammatical errors (commas, apostrophes) and added space to break up the wall of text.\"],\n",

The water stays on the surface of the penny due to a balance between the force of gravity pulling the water down and the surface tension pulling the molecules together.\\n\\nIt ends up being a question of surface area to volume ratio.  Surface tension has units of Newtons per meter, and the value for surface tension between water and air or water and other materials is a constant value at a given temperature and surfactant content.  Now over a given cross-section we can multiply the surface tension by the length of the interface and get some force value holding things together.  However, this force is balancing with the force of gravity pulling down on all the molecules within that cross section.\\n\\nAs the volume increases, the surface area and volume of course do not scale at the same rate.  For a sphere, for example, volume of course scales with the radius cubed and surface area with the radius squared.  So as you increase the final droplet size the volume to surface area ratio becomes much larger.  You therefore have an increasing effect of gravity on the water and a decreasing effect of surface tension until the point that gravity is greater than surface tension and the water spills down over the sides of the coin.'],\n",

       "   'MD here. Let\\'s use your example of a leg. For a leg fracture, many people think, \"oh that sucks, but you can\\'t die.\" WRONG. Many long bones, like the kinds in the arms and legs, contain fatty marrow inside of them. In a fracture, this fat can leak into the circulation and form a fat embolism. Regular clot emboli can be busted down by clot-dissolving drugs, but not fat. So you have all the risk of a clot embolism (traveling to the lungs and getting stuck) without any of the treatment options.\\n\\nCrush injuries are way worse though. It\\'s been estimated that up to 1/3 of the calorie intake of the body goes to one specific protein, the Na/K exchanger. This keeps sodium on the outside of the cell and potassium on the inside. Think of it like a way of forming a dam. If you want to run a process, you can use the energy of the sodium or potassium falling along it\\'s gradient (moving from areas of higher concentration to lower) to drive a given process. \\n\\nHere\\'s the issue though: Because sodium normally exists mostly outside cells, changing the concentration of sodium in the blood really won\\'t do much. Sure, anything in extreme causes problems, but the issue is more with potassium. A crush injury disrupts the membrane around cells, allowing them to leak potassium into the blood. If the body dedicates so much energy to keeping potassium inside, you can bet that it REALLY does not want it outside the cell, and sure enough, it messes with all kinds of tissues, most notably the heart. The heart tissue is supposed to conduct electricity in a specific rhythm so the heart can pump blood in a coordinated fashion. Disrupt the balance of sodium and potassium charges across the heart cell membrane, you get random firings that lead to cardiac arrest. This is why Potassium Chloride is used as the final, heart-stopping drug in a lethal injection mode of execution.\\n\\nBut it doesn\\'t stop there. Your muscles use a protein called myoglobin to bind oxygen that the blood\\'s oxygen-carrier hemoglobin brings to it. The myoglobin gives it to the muscle fibers to it can generate the energy required to contract. When you crush a muscle, you release myoglobin into the blood. Eventually, that blood circulates and tries to filter through the kidney, but the myoglobin gunks up the filtration system, causing renal failure. Eventually the normal nitrogenous wastes that form as a byproduct of normal metabolism will build up because the kidneys can\\'t do their job of filtering the bad off and keeping the good. \\n\\nLast point: any injury to soft tissue results in swelling, and a crush injury will 100% have swelling. Your limbs have different \"compartments,\" where connective tissue wraps around muscles and fat, keeping them in place. If the muscle is damaged, it will swell within its compartment, and the intra-compartment pressure will rise. You run into a problem when that pressure starts exceeding the blood pressure, because then there is a force against blood moving downstream. This can lead to tissue death from lack of blood and a HELL of a lot of pain.\\n\\nHow is this all treated? Muscle breakdown, called rhabdomyolysis, is treated through addressing both the potassium surge in the blood and the myoglobin release. Every meal you eat has a possibly lethal amount of potassium, but insulin doesn\\'t just shuttle sugar into your cells, it also moves potassium in. So insulin plus a little sugar is a pretty good temporary move to keep your potassium from getting out of control.\\n\\nMyoglobin-induced kidney failure is unfortunately a little less controlled. The best thing we can do is just flush the kidneys HARD. Literally the guidelines are \"give fluids until they are putting out 2 ml/kg body weight/hr of urine.\" If you weight 150 lbs (70 kg), that\\'s 140 mL urine every hour. This both dilutes the myoglobin in your blood AND keeps your kidney\\'s filtration system clear so nothing really sticks around long enough to mess stuff up.\\n\\nCompartment syndrome is treated by surgical \"fasciotomy,\" which is an incision in the \"fascia\", those bundles of connective tissue that keep everything in place. If you make a cut in it, it allows the damaged muscle to swell up without transmitting pressure to the nerves or blood vessels.\\n\\nComprehensive, but I hope this helps!',\n",

A marble rolling around a bowl isn't in equilibrium, but once it's come to rest at the bottom it is. In terms of chemistry, equilibrium does not necessarily mean that all the molecules stay the same, just that their numbers do. E.g. if you have ice in water with both at 0 C, then the amount of ice and water will stay the same - they're in equilibrium. But some of the ice will be thawing and some of the water freezing, but this happens at the same rate. At equilibrium the energy that can be used as work (Gibbs free energy) is minimized. Referring back to the first example, a rolling ball can be used to perform more mechanical work than it can once it's given off its energy as heat (through friction) and come to rest. \\n\\nBiological systems are far from equilibrium. You've got reactions going on all the time, chemical energy is being expended to maintain all your vital molecules in 'working condition', some of the energy is being lost as heat, etc.\\n\\nI'd say the BZ reaction is actually _not_ a big deal when it comes to thermodynamics but _kinetics_, which is a bit complementary to it in chemistry. Thermodynamics dictates that things will eventually reach equilibrium, their lowest-energy state. When things are in that state they're 'thermodynamically stable'. But thermodynamics doesn't say anything about _how long_ it will take to reach that state. \\n\\nMany things are in fact _not_ thermodynamically stable. At atmospheric pressure, diamonds have higher energy than graphite, and graphite surrounded by air would have less energy if it formed CO2. But at room temperature, neither of these things happen at any appreciable rate - they occur astronomically slowly. So for practical purposes they're stable, i.e. _kinetically stable_.\\n\\nThe BZ reaction does however reach thermodynamic equilibrium after a short while; it does not oscillate forever. But it demonstrates that even when reactions are headed towards thermodynamic equilibrium, they don't necessarily take a neat 'straight path' to it. In this case you have a whole set of competing reactions, whose kinetics affect each other to give rise to these oscillations. It's a chemical kinetics form of non-linear dynamics, which is something seen in lots of places, such as the oscillatory motion of a pendulum. (although the specific kinetics here are far more complicated than a pendulum, it's essentially the same kind of feedback mechanisms that lead to oscillatory behavior here)\\n\\nIf you burn some sugar in oxygen - ordinary combustion - it'll head very quickly straight to its lowest-energy state of water and CO2, giving off lots of heat. Contrast that to biological metabolism, with the citric acid cycle, electron transport chain and all that. The end products are the same, but the pathway taken is much longer and more complicated. In a way, most life is just a rather twisted path that energy that ultimately comes form the Sun takes, towards being converted to heat.\\n\\nThe BZ reaction in-itself isn't that interesting; every chemist knows of it but very few could tell you all the reactions involved. Mainly it makes for an vivid illustration that things don't necessarily reach chemical equilibrium quickly or directly.\"],\n",

The confidence interval takes the place of a p-value.

       "   \">  My main question is how do you interpret hazard ratios? And why does it look bimodal here, meaning a medium risk leads to lower risk of ALS death according to the HRs?\\n\\nHi.  Hazard ratios determine the likelihood of a negative event (ex: ALS mortality) compared to some reference group (ex: unexposed people).  So for the medium intensity exposure, you'd say that someone with medium intensity exposure to occupational CH2O is 27% less likely to die from ALS compared to unexposed people.  Those with high exposure are 1.53x MORE likely to die of ALS than unexposed people.\\n\\nThe point estimate is essentially useless if the confidence interval crosses one.  The 95% confidence interval tells you with 95% confidence that the real HR lies within that range.  So you can imagine that if  <  1 means less hazard,  >  1 means more hazard and 1 means same hazard, a confidence intervals that spans the entire range of  <  1 to  >  1 tells you that the results are essential non-significant statistically.\\n\\nThe fact that medium exposure is less likely to result in ALS death tells me the author probably did not account for some confounding factor in their adjusted HR.\"],\n",

This is a good approximation for some things, but is not quite the case in reality. In a dilute solution, water has a lot of degrees of freedom as it forms a very lose structure through hydrogen bonding between the water molecules. Almost all hydrogen bonds are thus water-water. At physiological temperature and pressure, the individual molecules break and reform the hydrogen bonds often as they rotate and translate around the solution.\\n\\nNow, if we take the reality of what biology looks like, it turns out that there is a lot more stuff floating around. Proteins, small molecules, DNA, and all the other stuff make for a pretty crowded environment. Water is excluded from a lot of the volume by minimizing hydrophobic surfaces. When the number of other molecules grows, the number of water-water interactions becomes smaller compared to water-other molecule interactions. This can lead to cases where water molecules are hydrogen bonding primarily to other molecules either in isolation or as a chain. Since the other molecules are typically larger (protein or DNA), they are a lot less flexible and can create a local energy minimum trapping the water molecules in the state of bonding. This is what is referred to as \"ordered water\". The water is essentially an extension of the molecule and does not have as many degrees of freedom as \"free water\" in solution. \\n\\nThe timescales of exchange of these ordered water molecules depends a lot on the environment. You should have no trouble finding articles. [This recent article](_URL_0_) for example, measured the exchange rate for a single protein with 4 buried waters to be between 0.1 and 200 us depending on the molecule.

       "  'text': [\"I'm not 100% sure if I am answering the right question. This could be one of two things--if you are asking about why skeletal muscles can contract right away and cardiac muscles can't, it has to do with tetany. If you can contract without any wait time, then you can keep contracting so quickly that the muscle never has time to relax. In skeletal muscle this can be ok if you want to sustain a contraction. On the other hand, in cardiac muscle this would be deadly because the heart needs to relax in oder to fill with blood (diastole). In order to achieve this, the refractory period (how long it takes before the ion pumps can repolarize the membrane) of cardiac muscle is longer. Skeletal and cardiac muscles have different ion pumps which explains the difference in how specific ions behave in the contraction cycle. This means that there is more time before the cardiac muscle can contract compared to a striated muscle contraction.\\n\\nIf on the other hand you are talking about the actual speed of contraction (one cycle) of cardiac versus skeletal muscle the answer gets a bit more complicated. The speed of contraction itself is called twitch, and even among skeletal muscle you have variance (anywhere from 10-100 ms). Cardiac muscle is around 300 ms, meaning the actual muscle contraction takes 300ms (vs 100ms at most for skeletal muscle). \\n\\nTo understand twitch more, you can take a look at fast and slow twitch muscles. Type I slow twitch skeletal muscles are usually bright red, filled with myoglobin, have tons of mitochondria, and work by utilizing O2 to aerobically make energy (ATP) for contraction. These fibers make and split ATP at a slow rate. They take longer to contract and generate less force, but can contract for sustained periods of time. An example is muscle for posture--back muscles.\\n\\nType II fast twitch skeletal muscle fibers tend to look pale and have much less myoglobin (less O2) and fewer mitochondria. On the other hand they have lots of glycogen--they get the energy they need to contract by anaerobic means, which takes significantly less time than aerobic metabolism. These fibers make and split ATP at a fast rate. These muscle contract more quickly and with more force, but the contraction cannot be sustained (remember anaerobic=less energy overall than aerobic per cycle). An example is muscles that move your eyes. Many muscle are a mix of fast and slow twitch fibers.\\n\\nHeart muscle fibers contract even more slowly than Type II slow twitch skeletal muscles. They are completely dependent on O2 as an energy source, and have even more mitochondria than a skeletal slow twitch muscle. At the same time cardiac muscle contraction requires a LOT of ATP. Although I can't seem to find a direct source saying so, I would assume that this means that even though cardiac muscle can make ATP at a faster rate, there is an increased demand, and the ATP may even be split at a slower rate. Since ATP splitting/use is directly proportional to contraction rate, this should be why cardiac muscle contracts slower than skeletal muscle. \\n\\n*Edit--also, to make things even more complicated, heart rate/and cardiac contraction time is modulated by hormones, calcium levels, etc.\"],\n",

At a fundamental level, the discipline of determining how materials respond to applied force is called *continuum mechanics*. Continuum mechanics is a very broad discipline that takes the fundamental laws that govern the motion of bodies (e.g. Newton\\'s Laws and conservation laws) and apply them to general materials - continuum mechanics approaches can be used to model fluids as well as solids, for example.  \\n\\nBut solid mechanics is what you\\'re after - the branch of continuum mechanics that deals with the general behavior of solids. A constitutive law is what provides the relationship between stresses (forces applied) and strains (material deformation).  In general, this constitutive law is quite complicated. For solids in the elastic range, (small deformations, which is what you design your building to undergo - in general, if your bridge or skyscraper sees plastic [permanent] deformation, something\\'s gone horribly wrong), under the linear assumption (i.e. stress is proportional to strain) there can be as many as 21 different constants that describe how the strain changes with the stress (or the stress changes with the strain).  In very simple cases, under simple applied loads, however, you can reduce everything down to something that might be familiar to you: analogous to Hooke\\'s law (F = -kx),  & sigma; = E & epsilon;.\\n\\nBut a fully continuum mechanics approach is impractical in general to take for a structure (indeed, it\\'s inapplicable to a structure, since the structure isn\\'t one continuous piece).  What happens is that these constitutive relations that describe how stress and strain interact are applied to each component of the building in much-simplified forms under various assumptions.  Bending stress is given by  & sigma; = -My/I; torsional stress is given by  & tau; = T & rho;/J; tensile or compressive stress is given by  & sigma; = F/A, and all these stresses are combined (typically using a formula to generate what\\'s called the \"von Mises stress\") to see whether the structure can support the loads required without \"yielding\" (experiencing plastic deformation).',\n",

Measuring health outcomes at the point of intervention**:  This is an extremely biased way of measuring the efficacy of healthcare for a few reasons.  First of all, it only measures the outcomes for people who get diagnosed and receive treatment; one of the main attacks on the US healthcare system is that the many uninsured, and the financial hardship associated with having a pre-existing condition, prevent many (especially the poor, who as we saw already have worse life expectancy) from seeking/receiving treatment at all.  In order for this statistic to be meaningful, it would have to show the life expectancy for everyone who *has* cancer, not everyone who gets *treated* for cancer.  Second, they only use the stats for breast cancer and rectal/colon cancer; the US has particularly fetishized mammograms and colonoscopies, my understanding is that they are detected significantly sooner in the US because we perform the tests more often than most medical boards would advise (though this is not my specific area of expertise, someone may be able to correct me).  Either way, for the statistic to be meaningful, they would have to report on a much wider range of diseases and conditions.\\n\\n**3.

Furthermore, the author presents no statistic or evidence, simply saying he'd 'bet' that the US would look better if we restricted what we were measuring.\\n\\nOverall, nothing here is really persuasive with the possible exception of point 3, which the 'update' casts doubt on (someone needs to check the original paper).

That is, visual information flows to the visual areas of cortex, not because of the potential for a perceived reward, but simply because, that is where the wires go.\\n\\nAlso, it is pretty well established that rewards alter the brain is wired up, but probably on a much smaller scale that the macroscopic activation of whole brain regions (at least on the moment to moment, minute to minute basis). And probably just involves strengthening little connections (synapses) that already exist).\\n\\nTo add more detail, there are certainly modifications to how the brain behaves when there is the potential for a reward. We don\\'t need to understand neuroscience to see this. If a rat is trained to pressed a lever when a bell goes for a food reward, it will learn that. It wont press the lever all the time, but 99% of the time, when the bell is sounding. Hence, the same visual stimuli (the room with the lever) produces two different behaviours depending on the expectation for a reward. Now, we could argue about does the rat really \"expect\" the reward, or has it been conditions to respond because of prior experience. But that is a bit outside the scope of this post.\\n\\nSo, to sum up: Different parts of the brain are activated by different tasks. This is due to the way the brain is wired up. Rewards can change how the brain is wired up, but probably only on a small scale (though this is debatable over the long term). Perception of rewards changes neural activity.',\n",

Sometimes when someone is telling the truth (and the poly says they're lying), and other times when they're lying (and the poly says they're telling the truth).\\n\\nThe [polygraph](_URL_1_) is an old, and relatively cheap system.

They can, if they are able to reliable determine if you are lying. The difference between lying and being nervous is that being nervous is a state. It will be reflected in the peripheral indices throughout the testing session.\\n\\nThe way that a poly is typically done is to ask a series of simple questions. What happens to the peripheral markers in *response* to these questions (event-related responses) is what the examiner will be evaluating. If you are nervous, this will be visible prior to the question being asked, but whether or not you're telling the truth/lying should still be visible in those peripheral markers above and beyond your baseline state. That is, if the test is doing it's job.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, the poly is not a great tool. It's prone to failure, it requires the person to be compliant, and it can be fooled, and quite easily.

The nuclei of the two elements fuse together, as the name suggests. The sun releases energy due to fusion: it combines hydrogen and helium to form heavier elements. When the fused element\\'s nucleus has 26 or fewer protons, energy is released. When the end product has more than 26 protons, it requires energy to fuse. \\n\\nSo... why can\\'t we take a bunch of hydrogen, fuse it to make helium, and harness the energy? Well... atomic nuclei are positively charged. As you know, positive charges repel one another. In order for fusion to occur, the atoms have to be VERY close to each other. It\\'s extremely difficult to bring hydrogen atoms into the proximity at which fusion occurs: they repel each other too strongly at almost all imaginable conditions. The energy that\\'s required to bring the two hydrogen atoms together is called the \"activation energy.\" This activation energy is ginormous. Many physicists supply this activation energy by using extremely high temperatures. Many physicists believe that it is physically impossible to supply the atoms with the necessary activation energy at \"cold\" temperatures. That\\'s what cold fusion is... the idea that it is possible to fuse atoms at cold temperatures. \\n\\nThen... a couple scientists came along and claimed that, in the presence of palladium (a rare metal that is similar to platinum), hydrogen atoms can come so close to each other that they actually fuse together at room temperature! They ran this reaction in a container filled with water. Their \"evidence\" that cold fusion took place was that the temperature of the water skyrocketed almost instantaneously. \\n\\nThey published their results in a very low-tier journal, and apparently, the editor was so pleased to see a \"high impact\" paper ending up in his journal that he didn\\'t even proof read it. Thus, the paper wasn\\'t really peer reviewed. Nobody tried reproducing it before it was sent out the door. It was just published. Once word got out, people all around the world starting trying to reproduce it, but not a single soul could. \\n\\nThe experiment itself is really easy. Anybody that does electrochemistry has tried this reaction (by accident or not). My lab studies completely different reactions (obviously, as no self-respecting scientist believes the original result), but we set up systems that should reproduce this result hundreds of times a week. \\n\\nYou can try it yourself for almost no money.

Most fusion experiments only operate for a few seconds at a time. This is actually long enough to do the science that we need to understand confinement. But we need to develop the science and technologies to extend the pulse lengths and operate steady state.\\n\\nDisruptions: Tokamak's can go unstable and suddenly lose confinement. These sudden loss of confinement events can damage the reactor. We need to develop better control of the plasma to avoid disruptions, and also develop mitigation systems to protect the reactor in the event of an disruption. \\n\\nMaterials: The inside of a burning fusion reactor is a very harsh environment. We need to develop materials that can withstand this environment for prolonged periods of time.\\n\\nSize: Right now we only know how to build a large burning fusion reactor. Large reactors are expensive and costly. In order to be economically viable (and to speed up the rate research) we need to find a way to shrink the size of a burning reactor.  \\n\\nPredictability: Plasma physics is a challenging field of study.

Basically, you take a large stone (some rocks, like flint, work better than others – that could be your first clue that what your holding is an artefact) and hit it with another rock to shear off a flake. Repeat this a few times and you have two useful products: any number of sharp flakes, and the original rock itself, which can be shaped into any number of useful forms.\\n > \\n >  There aren't many natural processes that would do that. So if you find those signature flakes or cores there's a good chance they were made by humans. This find from Turkey isn't the best example, since there's only one flake (so far). Finding multiple flakes or shaped cores together would be more of a smoking gun. In that case you'd probably be looking at a butchery site or camp, so there's a good chance there'd also be other evidence pointing to human activity: animal bones with cut marks, human bones, etc.\\n > \\n >  >  How clear cut is an isolated collection of shards? If a piece of flint tumbles down a hill and shatters, how different does that look from something that was deliberately knapped?\\n > \\n >  Not a great deal different. That is a difficulty with very old finds like this (later on you're more likely to see specific tool forms, retouching, and other tell-tale signs). But they are distinguishable to the expert eye. There a subtle features on the surface of a flake struck off by a human hand that you're very unlikely to see on natural flakes shattered by erosion, and you can also look at the environment the artefact was found in to see if it's likely you'd find naturally shattered flint there. In the case of this find from Turkey they had both lines of evidence. I'll just quote the relevant section of the paper^* in full:\\n > \\n >  >  The artefact (inferred to be a hard hammer product) has a **visible striking platform** and a clearly-developed **bulb of percussion** with minor stress fissuring on the proximal ventral surface (Fig. 4a). There is evidence for at least two **prior removals** on the dorsal surface, including one flake scar terminating in a hinge fracture (Fig. 4b). The presence of at least two removals makes it highly unlikely that this results from natural processes. Although the gravels of U1, along with those from the higher terrace sequence, contain large quartzitic clasts, these tend to display flat fractures and despite the counting and identification of thousands of clasts from these and similarly-derived gravels, we have **not observed any comparable clasts** within the Lower Pleistocene sequence. Furthermore, it is widely accepted that flake-mimicking humanly-struck material can only be convincingly generated in high energy environments e.g. beaches (Bridgland et al., 1997). **None of the sediments in this sequence represent high energy transport**. Even the overlying slope sediment, which is composed almost entirely of basalt, results from depositional processes associated with low angle slides along weak shallow failure planes within the underlying Miocene Ahmetler Formation, together with less abrupt low energy mass movements. Thus, the occurrence of this flake within the fine-grained alluvial sequence is distinctive and unusual and its form is highly unlikely to have resulted from natural erosion processes.\\n > \\n >  [And here's the figure they refer to.](_URL_0_)\\n > \\n >  I've emphasised the key pieces of evidence for it being an artificial flake:\\n > \\n >  * **Visible striking platform** – getting predictably shaped flakes from the rough natural surface of a rock is hard, so flintknappers usually started by splitting the core in half to get a flat *platform* to work off. A bit of that flat surface is left at the top of the flake.\\n > \\n >  * **Bulb of percussion** – in the picture in the left you can quite clearly see a lump at the top of the flake where the hammerstone hit it, with little ripples radiating out from it.\\n > \\n >  * **Prior removals** – this wasn't the first flake struck off from the original core; the picture on the right shows two indentations where other flakes were detached beforehand.\\n > \\n >  * **Not observed any comparable clasts** – the authors note that while there is a lot of shattered rock in the area, they've done their due diligence and haven't found similar fracture patterns on any of them, meaning this one is unlikely to have been produced by the same (presumably natural) processes.\\n > \\n >  * **None of the sediments in this sequence represent high energy transport** – humans hit hard with concentrated force to produce flakes, so you'd have to be in an environment where rocks were getting bashed around a *lot* to find something that would look similar (the authors give the example of a beach, your example of a rock tumbling down a very steep slope could conceivably manage it too). This doesn't look to be such an environment.\\n > \\n >  So although this is a very tricky identification – a single flake in very old sediment – the authors do make a convincing case for it being artificial.\\n > \\n >  -----\\n > \\n >  ^* Maddy et al.

Some opiates can, and will bind to other kinds of opioid receptors other than just the mu receptor. The main reason you become hungry for foods that provide a reward(taste really sweet, stuff you enjoy anyway, just maybe not to the same degree) DOES have to do with the mu receptor in that you're getting more reward out of something already rewarding(being on an opiate, be it for pain or recreation you are going to feel rewarded using the drug) but the biggest reason has to do with kappa-type 3 opioid receptor(also known as the nociceptin receptor) which actually increases appetite.

The main reason is that, evolutionarily speaking, all mammals have lungs and breath air. Mammals can't breathe water, because they don't have the necessary morphological components to do so. They could not have re-evolved gills in a strict sense, because, in mammals, the gill arches have evolved into inner ear bones and other components of the head skeleton and can no longer be used to support gill tissue. \\n\\nSecondly, mammals are warm-blooded and must thermoregulate carefully, and therefore even the smallest mammals do not take in much oxygen through the skin. This would require direct contact between the skin and the environment, which is something that a thermoregulating animal can't afford, due to the potential for heat loss. Furthermore, this holds true for other types of respiratory tissue in addition to skin. Even if aquatic mammals could have evolved some sort of gill tissue, that tissue would still need to be in constant contact with the water, losing heat to the environment and making it harder to thermoregulate. \\n\\nGills are actually quite efficient, for a number of reasons. Most importantly, they have an incredible amount of surface area and vascularization (blood vessels). Each gill arch has many gill filaments, which in turn are covered with microscopic flaps of tissue, meaning that a lot of tissue surface area is compacted into one small structure. Some sharks (such as whale sharks and basking sharks) can get quite large, but not as large as whales. \\n\\nThe other thing to consider is that the largest marine mammals (whales) are not doing much breathing. Gills can function as long as they are submerged in water, but a whale must surface to take in a volume of air. Even then, the lungs don't stay inflated for long, due to the diving behaviors that large whales exhibit. Air is highly compressible, so as soon as the whale begins her descent, the lungs will collapse due to the increase in pressure, and the gasses will be dissolved into the blood stream. Whales have many adaptations to reduce their need for oxygen, so that they don't have to surface often.\\n\\nThe question of why whales are the largest animals on earth is hotly debated, but it likely has little to do with having lungs. The most compelling thing that I have heard is that they are large because they are able to obtain a tremendous amount of food as oceanic filter feeders. \\n\\nTo answer your last question, I would say that the primary advantage of being large is being harder to take down by a predator.

The server can still know what this number will be so authenticates. \\n\\nThere is another way it could work. This is the method commonly used by things like car alarm remotes. Rather than being based on time, it could possibly be based on order. If the token generates a code, and the next time generates a new code as part of a sequence rather than based on a clock. The server knows the same sequence but will accept one of the next hundred codes as an authentication rather than the very next code. This allows for people generating a code and not using it, or in the case of car alarm remotes, people pressing the button in their pocket when not near the car. The probability of guessing what one of those next hundred codes is will be very small as it is a 6 digit code, and repeated entries of an incorrect code will lock the account anyway.\\n\\nWith either system, it is secure because if you steal the token you do not know the pin, thus it is useless.

If we tell one generator to produce more, and another to produce less, it will change how power flows on the power lines. \\n\\nPower lines are just metal cables. Much like an old incandescent light bulb that gets too hot to touch when it is running, power lines will heat up when electricity flows through them. Like any metal, if it gets too hot the properties start to change. Our job is to then control the way power flows by changing generator outputs in a way that keeps lines from carrying too much power. This keeps power lines from overheating. \\n\\nFor an example, imagine a very simple system. You have a generator with several power lines that lead away from it. One of those lines goes directly to a city. All of the load in the city is going to pull power over that particular power line. Let\\'s say the city\\'s demand goes higher then normal and it starts pulling too much power on that line causing it to overheat. Once option might be turning down the power plant and letting more power flow into the city from its other power lines. By having less power at that generator and having generator elsewhere produce replacement power, you shift the overall flows. \\n\\nNow let\\'s say we have a situation where *all* of the lines going to the city are overloading.

       "   'I\\'ll explain in very broad terms. If anything in particular piques your interest, I\\'ll be more than glad to expand on it.    \\n\\nFinding integer solutions to polynomial equations is extremely important. In fact, you can argue it is universal (see [Hilbert\\'s 10th problem](_URL_14_)): every set of integers which can be enumerated by an algorithm can be described as a set of solutions to some system of polynomial equations.    \\n\\nSo being able to solve polynomial equations with integers is crucial. For instance, you could use that ability to generate prime numbers. You could factorise large primes. A huge amount of crytography rides on the difficulty of solving such equations ([Diophantine equations](_URL_14_)).    \\n\\nAn approach towards understanding these equations is in two parts:\\n\\n * Instead of trying to solve the equations with integers, allow any real numbers (or complex numbers). The set of solutions you get will turn out to be interesting spaces which you can study for their own sake. An example would be [elliptic curves](_URL_14_), which come up as solutions to equations such as y^2 = x^3 + ax + b, and whose full set of (complex) solutions is a [torus](_URL_14_) with extra structure. The geometry of these spaces will relate back to Diophantine equations (see [Falting\\'s theorem](_URL_14_)).\\n * Then try to bring this back down to rational numbers and integers by using Galois descent (I\\'ll explain).\\n\\nWhat Galois descent means is actually quite intuitive. The idea is that there are many symmetries of the set of complex numbers... (this forms a [group](_URL_14_), which just means you can compose and invert symmetries) and the rational solutions to an equation correspond to points on the space of complex solutions which do not move when you apply such a symmetry. This is the same idea as saying that a complex number is actually real if it is equal to its complex conjugate, except now the set (or rather, group) of symmetries is incredibly complicated. It is so complicated that it is conjectured that every finite group of symmetries can be found inside this group (the [inverse Galois problem](_URL_14_)).    \\n\\nSo the crucial thing to understand now is these symmetries and how they can move around these points on these sets of complex solutions to polynomial equations (called algebraic varieties). This is one of the things where [representation theory](_URL_14_) is very successful: it tries to understand a group of symmetries by looking at how the symmetries move around flat space (as opposed to, for instance, just moving some finite set of points around). The Langlands program tells us the full picture of the representation theory of this group of symmetries, which is the best way anyone has of thinking of this extremely complicated structure. It does so by relating to objects called automorphic forms, which are a generalisation of modular forms (this would be the 2-dimensional case of the Langlands program, linking modular forms to how this group of symmetries acts on a plane).    \\n\\nThe game is very subtle, it\\'s not clear exactly why these mysterious \"automorphic\" objects appear. Often, these are functions you can cook up which just tabulate how many solutions your set of equations has modulo various primes, just like in yangyangR\\'s answer... but somehow these functions are not artifical, and possess amazing symmetries of their own. Look at [this image](_URL_14_). There\\'s a group of symmetries here that takes any piece of this tesselation to any other (for instance you have a translation by 1 along the x-axis, and you have something which does an [inversion](_URL_14_) (taking the shaded piece into the kind of triangular shaped piece just below it). So the amazing thing about these functions (called modular forms), is that they don\\'t change when you apply such a symmetry (or change in a predictable, meaningful way which gives rise to so called [line bundles](_URL_14_) over this space). It\\'s incredible. You just tabulated numbers of solutions modulo p, and managed to get this amazing function which transforms beautifully, and has all this structure going for it. These functions turn out to naturally form representations, and they relate to representations of your original group of symmetries.  \\nIn the case of these modular forms, you are relating two dimensional representations of your group of symmetries, with any-dimensional representation of the [algebraic group](_URL_14_) GL_2 .\\n\\nEven without such strong results, the general philosophy behind the Langlands program has been extremely successful. For instance, if you want to produce a set of complex numbers which has a given group of symmetries (trying to solve the inverse Galois problem for a particular group), your best bet might actually be to figure out how it works on the other side of the bridge, by looking at automorphic forms.    \\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll note that Edward Frenkel\\'s work is more concerned about the geometric Langlands program. This is essentially the same game, except that you don\\'t work with complex numbers but instead with [function fields](_URL_14_). In this case, you have a geometric object to study: the curve which has as function field the function field you are studying. Then representations of the relevant Galois group (which is a kind of fundamental group) become [local systems](_URL_14_). So there\\'s a shift in the language used, but it\\'s in essence the same principles at the core of it.'],\n",

How fast the voltage values can change is determined by the parasitic capacitance of the circuit and the drive current of the transistor. This allows us to consider how long it takes for an input signal applied to a circuit to result in a valid output signal.\\n\\nIn an synchronous (i.e. clock based) circuit, there are data storage blocks called registers which act like the source or destination of a computation. At the start of every clock cycle, the registers 'clock in' the output of some logic circuit. Because the speed of signal propagation through a logic circuit is finite, there must be a minimum amount of time required for the the output of the logic to become valid. By finding this delay required, we know the maximum frequency we can clock this circuit. If we go above this frequency, the registers will likely store junk instead of valid data.\\n\\nA GPU is a very large circuit made up of synchronous logic so therefore there is an maximum frequency we can clock the GPU. Since max frequency is dependent on analog factors in the circuit, it stands to reason that we can hold the frequency constant and vary the factors to produce a functional or non-functional GPU.\\n\\n**Back to your question:**\\n\\nOne of the factors is temperature. As you increase the temperature, the drive current in the transistor decreases. Propagation speed is decreased and maximum frequency goes down. If your GPU is clocked at a higher frequency than this new maximum, then the computations will go wrong.\\n\\nEdit: Correction\",\n",

The reasoning is that unless you overclock your GPU, you'll only ever get a cosmic ray bit-flip once in a while, and you'll end up with a 1 frame artifact. Most likely, this artifact will only affect one single pixel, which very few people will ever notice.\\n\\nAs far as price/quality compromises go, this is a no-brainer.\\n\\nHowever, it does mean that if something goes wrong with the fan, or if a user overclocks his GPU, you'll get uncontrollable artifacts.

They are chopped up by various enzymes into smaller organic molecules, some of which are useful, and some of which are waste that is exhaled (CO2).\\n\\nMore along the lines of Glucose undergoes a series of reactions called [Glycolysis](_URL_2_) that turns it into a differeny molecule that can go through a specially designed energy creating pathway, [The Krebs Cycle](_URL_1_).\\n\\nGlycolysis itself releases a little bit of energy as ATP, but not much.  It's what organisms that don't breathe oxygen use, because the Krebs Cycle requires oxygen to function.  The goal of glycolysis in humans is to turn glucose (6 carbons) into two molecules of pyruvate (3 carbons each, totaling 6).  Each of those pyruvate molecules can go through the Krebs Cycle.\\n\\n > At that point, various enzymes start oxidizing them, stealing Hydrogen atoms. These Hydrogen atoms are passed from enzyme to enzyme, eventually resulting in the proton being pushed out of the mitochondria, while the electron remains within the mitochondria (attached to some protein).\\n\\n > That electron is then used inside the mitochondria to turn O2 (which you breathed in) into water, with the addition of some H+ ions from within the mitochondria. The net effect of all of this, is that a bunch of H+ have been pumped outside the mitochondria, and some more H+ has been turned into water, within the mitochondria. Therefore there is an electric potential across the mitochondrial membrane.\\n\\nNot quite, but not too far off either, surprisingly close for the second part.  We'll go back to the Krebs Cycle real quick.  So, to start off, pyruvate kicks off a CO2, and it gets replaced with a CoA molecule, so you're left with a 2 carbon Acetyl-CoA molecule that enters into the Krebs Cycle by joining with a 4 carbon oxaloacetate molecule.  This gives a 6 carbon molecule that starts the Krebs Cycle.\\n\\nLong story short, it undergoes a bunch of reactions that change the conformation, release 2 more CO2 molecules, release a little bit more energy as ATP, and also drop off the CoA, leaving you with the oxaloacetate molecule we talked about before.  This oxaloacetate molecule is now free to join up with another Acetyl-CoA and the cycle can continue.\\n\\nAnother important (probably the most important) aspect of the Krebs Cycle is that it produces reduced molecules, like NADH and FADH2 by giving protons to NAD+ and FADH+.  These NADH/FADH2 molecules go to the [Electron Transport Chain](_URL_0_), where they can really release a lot of energy.\\n\\n\\n\\n > That electron is then used inside the mitochondria to turn O2 (which you breathed in) into water, with the addition of some H+ ions from within the mitochondria. The net effect of all of this, is that a bunch of H+ have been pumped outside the mitochondria, and some more H+ has been turned into water, within the mitochondria. Therefore there is an electric potential across the mitochondrial membrane.\\nThere is one more protein, which is actually attached to the membrane, but porous to H+ ions. The electric potential forces the H+ ions through this protein, which uses that motive energy to build ATP, which the cell then uses for all its energy needs.\\n\\nThe proteins of the electron transport chain work literally as a chain to transport electrons.  They take a hydrogen off the NADH/FADH2, use the electron for redox reactions, and the H+ goes into a big pool of H+'s on one side of a membrane (think of it like a holding room).  The electric potential isn't so much important as the concentration gradient. Also, all the proteins of the Electron Transport are attached to the membrane, that's how they can all pump H+ across it.\\n\\nStill with me?  OK, this is where the real energy comes from.  The Electron Transport Chain creates a concentration gradient of H+ on one side of a membrane, which it then uses to produce ATP.  Literally, think it of a bunch of people exiting a room one by one through a turnstile, and then using the spinning of the that turnstile as a generator.\\n\\nIt's a pretty interesting thing, [ATP Synthase](_URL_3_) is that turnstile protein, and it literally looks like a turnstile.  It's not completely understood how it works, but that passage of H+ through the protein literally turns the top part around in a circle as it passes through, generating energy. \\n\\nThe movement of H+ through this turnstile is what generates the energy for your body to turn ADP (2 phosphates) and P into ATP (3 phosphates).  The final phosphate bond is a high energy bond that can be broken and energy can be released from it.  ATP is like the energy currency of your body, and it's used in tons of reactions.\\n\\nYour body takes the H+ that moves through the turnstile, combines them with O2 (remember how I said the Krebs cycle requires O2?  This is the only reason why.  Electron Transport isn't technically the Krebs Cycle, but your body won't even start the Krebs Cycle unless it has O2 because it would be a waste to produce all those reduced molecules and have nothing do use them for).  This produces H2O.  The CO2s that got knocked off during the Krebs Cycle, along with the CO2 are breathed out, and the ATP molecules are used for energy.\\n\\n\\nSorry if this is confusing.  It was kind of hard for me to format because I just have this tiny text box.  Hope that helped.\",\n",

However, the way that this \\'decision\\' to fire or not fire gets built up into more complicated codes does not remotely resemble machine logic systems.  For example, some neurons take this \\'binary\\' event and turn it into a continuous, non-binary variable:  Firing *rate*.  They fire at a higher or lower rate (more spikes per second) to convey information.  In this way, neural networks are very probabilistic, and their inputs and outputs are generally continuously variable (in the form of firing rate), rather than binary.\\n\\nLong answer:\\n\\nNeural systems can actually use a pretty impressive variety of coding schemes to represent information.  An excellent example of this is in the auditory system (hearing).  At the cochlea, the point of input, where sound is actually being detected by neurons, there are two different coding schemes at work:  Place coding and rate coding.  For most frequencies of sound, place coding is used:  Some neurons fire for sounds that contain frequencies around 60 Hz, and another group of neurons fires for sounds that contain frequencies around 61 Hz, etc. etc. etc., and this is called \"place coding\" because the frequency of a tone is encoded by which cells fire (\\'place\\' refers to the locations of different neurons).  \"Place coding\" cells increase their firing rate to indicate greater intensity of a stimulus; their firing rate has *nothing* to do with the frequency of the sound.\\n\\nBuuut, some other cells (ones that respond to really low frequencies) in the cochlea use \"rate coding.\"  If the sound is a 40 Hz tone, the cell fires 40 spikes per second.\\n\\nThen, in OTHER systems, sometimes the specific pattern of spikes that a neuron fires encodes information (e.g. - ---- - ---- means something different from -- --- ---- -, whereas in a place coding scheme these would mean the same thing, since they both contain the same overall number of spikes).\\n\\nIt gets rapidly more complicated from there.'],\n",

To produce insight moments, they use what they call \"compound remote associates\" problems. Subjects are given three words (e.g., \"crab\", \"pine\", and \"sauce\"), and asked to think of another word that can form a compound word with all three of the ones presented. In this case, the right answer is \"apple\" (crabapple, pineapple, applesauce).\\n\\nBehavioral studies have shown that sometimes people appear to solve these problems slowly and analytically (e.g., think of possible solutions methodically -- crabgrass? pinecone? hotsauce? -- and then test each candidate against the other words until you find one that fits all three), whereas other times the solution just seems to pop out suddenly, with no conscious thought process underlying it.\\nWhen they have people perform this task during EEG or in an fMRI scanner, the most obvious thing that seems to be happening when people get a solution via insight (versus methodically) is a burst of activity in the right temporal cortex at about the same time that they think of the solution.\\n\\nInterestingly, they\\'ve also found that activity PRECEDING the solution makes a difference -- in essence, brain activity is always fluctuating a little bit, and they have found that when activity in the temporal lobes is higher just before the problem is presented, the problem is more likely to be solved via insight than when fluctuations in those areas are lower.

I\\'ll probably make a big edit at some point to make things easier if this thread gets a lot of upvotes.\\n\\nTo start with we need to understand a very basic attack called a \"buffer overrun\" (there are lots of other names but this is what I will use). When your program is running there is a stack. On the stack is a series of \"stack frames\", one for each method in the call history. In a stack frame are two relevant things for us: (1) local variables for a method and (2) a return address. What happens when a method returns is the program looks at the return address and then jumps to that address and keeps executing. This is how I can call a method from two different contexts and have it return to the right code. A stack overflow attack is going to pollute this return address with attacker controlled content. Basically, if you have a vulnerability in your program that allows somebody to write *more* data onto the stack than there is room for the local variables then it will just write over the next thing, which is the return address! Now the attacker can control where the program will jump to after the method ends.\\n\\nSo the attacker needs to do two things now: (1) get his code into memory somehow and (2) jump to it. Well, you gave him a way of writing tons of stuff onto the stack so he can just write his *code* onto the stack. Problem 1 solved. So what address does he write into the return address? Well, if he can figure out the address of the stack frame he is writing into then he can do some arithmetic and figure out the address of the code he injected. When your method ends now the program jumps to the attacker\\'s code and executes it. This attack is among the most common and powerful kinds of attacks on system code. \\n\\nALSR helps solve problem 2. If the address space of a program cannot be determined before runtime then the attacker has a **much** more difficult time figuring out the address of the code he wants to jump to. He can inject code, but maybe his jump will miss it. Other vulns that leak runtime address locations can help an attacker defeat this attack. There are other ways around ALSR too, but in general it exists to make it *harder but not impossible* for an attacker to know the address of data at runtime. This is useful for stopping code injection attacks, but will also be useful later. \\n\\nDEP says we can\\'t execute code that is on the stack (or in the heap). This means that even if the attacker injects some code and jumps to it, the program will not be allowed to execute his instructions. Seems great, right? Well, there is a way around this called a \"return to libc attack\" or \"return oriented programming\". The idea here is that all of the code that the attacker really wants to execute already exists inside libc somewhere. He just needs to figure out how to jump to the right bits of it in the right order. So DEP makes attacks harder but not impossible. \\n\\nBut wait! If we used both ALSR and DEP then jumping to the right places in libc becomes *really* hard. The attacker can\\'t use tricks like nop slides to make it so he just needs to get close to the target address. He needs to be right on the money and he doesn\\'t get to know the address layout ahead of time. Again, still not impossible to defeat but now the attacker\\'s job is much more difficult because he needs to figure out the location of libc in the executable (ignoring some details here), which is going to be difficult.'],\n",

For instance, suppose you are an observer far away from the black hole and are using so-called Schwarzschild coordinates to describe some non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole. To you, all infalling particles never actually reach the horizon. They just slow down to a halt as they approach the horizon, and so the acceleration of all objects approaching the horizon *in this coordinate system* is zero!\\n\\nThat probably doesn't quite match the answer you expect. Since it becomes harder and harder to escape the pull of the black hole as you get closer, you should expect the acceleration to get larger. There *is* a way to describe that intuitive notion. Some background terms first. When a particle moves under gravity alone (the particle is said to be *free*), we say that the *proper acceleration* of that particle is zero. Or simply, the acceleration of the particle is zero. If a particle is subjected to non-gravitational forces, then the resulting proper acceleration is non-zero.\\n\\nSo the meaningful question to ask is the following: suppose a particle is falling into the black hole under gravity alone. Its proper acceleration is zero. If the particle (or spaceship or whatever) were to fire its rockets and fight against the pull of the black hole, it could accelerate hard enough so that it remains stationary according to the faraway observer. *What, then, is the proper acceleration needed to exactly counteract the geodesic motion into the black hole?* Well, there turns out to be a simple enough answer (although not quite trivial to derive). If the particle has Schwarzschild radial coordinate *r*, then the required proper acceleration needed is\\n\\n >  *a* = √[r / (r - r*_s_*)] GM/r^(2)\\n\\nwhere M = mass of black hole and r*_s_* = 2GM/c^(2) = Schwarzschild radius of the black hole. Note two important things:\\n\\n 1. If *r* is much larger than *r**_s_* (true for the exterior of a star or planet), we find that *a* = GM/r^(2), which is just the usual Newtonian formula for gravitational acceleration.\\n\\n 2. As *r* -- >  *r**_s_*, then *a* -- >  infinity. That is, for *any* black hole, the proper acceleration required to counteract the gravity gets arbitrarily large as you approach the event horizon. In other words, if you were to successfully escape the pull of a black hole while just outside the horizon, you would feel an *incredible* amount of *g*'s and that's quite an understatement.\",\n",

Depending on the size of the black hole, the \"inner\" part of the ship may experience enough more gravitational force than the \"outer\" part of the ship, causing differing pulls, called tidal forces.

As muscle activity is necessarily a shortening, it will always have a 'pulling' effect: i.e. it will act to approximate its origin and insertion. This is why when you tense your biceps brachii muscle - which originates from your scapula (shoulder blade) and inserts into your radius (one of the bones of your forearm), flexion of the elbow occurs (as well as other actions including turning of the forearm and shoulder joint flexion).\\n\\nThe muscles of the tongue follow the same principles but may appear to have slightly confusing actions, due to their origins/insertion not being completely bony (as was the case with the example above). Da Vinci may be talking about protrusion of the tongue, which appears to be pushing the tongue outwards. However, this is brought about by a muscle named genioglossus, which originate on the internal surface of your chin (i.e. the mandible) and inserts into the muscular body of the tongue. Contraction of this muscle therefore appears to 'push' the tongue out of the mouth. The 'pushing' effect of this muscle is evident in unilateral vagus nerve lesions (the vagus nerve innervates the muscle). When asked to protrude the tongue, the tongue will be observed to move towards the affected side, almost as if it were being pushed over by the still-functioning muscle.\\n\\nIn terms of genitals, I am not entirely sure what he is talking about. If he is considering the erectile tissues (of the penis and clitoris), then these are in fact not muscles, but rather spongy tissues capable of receiving blood. He may be talking about the muscles which are involved with pushing blood into the erectile tissues (ischiocavernosus, bulbospongiosus), but these still function by contracting around a blood reservoir, forcing blood into the penis.\\n\\nThis is, however, solely considering one type of muscle (skeletal). There are further examples of what could be considered 'pushing' in cardiac muscle (in the heart) and smooth muscle (lining various tubes in the body: the digestive tract, the vascular system). However these too function by shortening. If we consider peristalsis in the gut - one of the methods by which food is pushed along from mouth to anus - constriction behind the food bolus and relaxation in front of it appear to push it onwards: this is still, however, shortening and constriction (this action is also present in the urogenital systems, but I'm not sure how much knowledge Da Vinci had of smooth muscle).\\n\\nHope this kinda answers your question!\\n\\nSource: Have just finished my anatomy and physiology courses as part of my medicine degree (of course there are people out there who know a lot more about this stuff than I do, but I thought I would be able to give a decent answer - let me know if I've got anything muddled!)\",\n",

I'll use your example of learning an association between a stimulus and a reward (food). This may be more info than you wanted, but it's still pretty cool. I don't know what your background is, so feel free to ignore me if this is all stuff you already know.\\n\\nIn your example of Pavlov's dogs, the bell actually rings **right before** the food is put in the mouth, not at the same time. Perfect co-presence of the 2 stimuli is much less likely to cause an association to be made in Classical Conditioning. Classical conditioning involves the pairing of an outside stimulus with an instinctual reflex. The dog is going to salivate if food is put into its mouth. Once the dog has associated the bell ringing with receiving food, the dog will salivate when the bell rings because the association is made.\\n\\nSomewhat more complicated Operant Conditioning involves the animal doing something and receiving a reward (usually food). The original experiments involved rats hitting a button to get a food pellet. So knowing to hit the button to get food is one type of association. They could also train the rats to only hit the button when a bell rings, by not giving them food when they hit the button unless the bell has rung.\\n\\nThese are just experiments, but these animals use other cues in their natural habitat to know when food is available (and also to fulfill other drives). Essentially, animals are hard-wired to look for these cues. It's part of the reward mechanisms of the brain, which involve the hypothalamus (central drive area), the nucleus accumbens (in the basal ganglia), and the medial forebrain bundle (connects midbrain to the nucleus accumbens). The main components of this mechanism are *Wanting* and *Liking*. The part where animals learn the cues is related to the *Wanting* component. As mentioned, the cue signals availability of the food, and this *Wanting* system activates. Dopamine is released in the nucleus accumbens. This is essential for the animal to be motivated to seek out the food, to want it. So the animal is motivated to seek out the food, and when it obtains the food, endorphins are released, also in the nucleus accumbens. These endorphins create the *Liking* component to reward, causing the animal to enjoy the food it has acquired.\\n\\nThe dopamine release is what causes the animal to learn the association between certain cues and certain rewards. It aids in *long-term potentiation* within the nucleus accumbens, which is when repeated activation of synapses increases their strength. Long-term potentiation enlarges axon terminals and generates new receptor sites on the post-synaptic membrane of the connecting neuron. This means neuron 1 has a greater chance of causing an action potential in neuron 2. This long-term potentiation is the Hebbian theory mutilated_bonsai described.\\n\\nThis LTP process occurs in other areas of the brain involved in learning, as well, such as the amygdala (fear learning) and the hippocampus (encodes short-term memory into long-term).\\n\\nHopefully this makes some sort of sense.

So yes it's primarily meant to help with pain but for full recovery should be used with compression (wrapping with a bandage) rest (immobilization of the muscle) and elevation (keeping above the heart).\\n\\nHowever if you have in injury like a sprained ankle you should use the MEAT treatment method (movement, exercise, analgesics, treatment).\"],\n",

Further, we don\\'t really care about the exponential function, we care about the Additive Rule for Exponents: a^(x+y)=a^(x)a^(y). For instance, if f(x) is a (nice) function that satisfies f(x+y)=f(x)f(y) (ie, it turns addition into multiplication), then it *has to be* a function that looks like f(x)=a^(x) for some x. This is because if x and y are real, then the Additive Rule implies the Multiplicative Rule f(xy)=f(x)^(y), this means that f(x)=f(1x)=f(1)^(x), so a=f(1).   This rule is key to many applications, like probability, compound interest, exponential growth/decay, thermodynamics and (if you include imaginary exponents) trigonometry, and it is also key for many theoretical things as well.  This rule pops up so often because it changes addition into multiplication, and the need for this kind of manipulation pops up all over the place.\\n\\nIn what follows I assume familiarity with Calculus.\\n\\nThe thing is, if we study the addition rule enough, you\\'ll always get to e. If we start using Calculus to study this property, then we\\'ll find that the Differential Equation dy/dx=Cy (with initial condition y(0)=1) is just a fancy way to state the addition rule: A differentiable function that satisfying f(x+y)=f(x)f(y) is equivalent to a function satisfying the equation f\\'(x)=Cf(x) for some constant C (and f(0)=1). We can show this without ever coming up with the idea of exponentiation, all that is needed are derivatives and f(x+y)=f(x)f(y). \\n\\nThe caveat about f\\'(x)=Cf(x) that is a little ugly is that C out there. What happens if C=1? Then we have the equation f\\'(x)=f(x), we\\'ll call this the \"Best Additive Rule\" because it\\'s equivalent to f(x+y)=f(x)f(y), but it\\'s in the nicest form possible. We know that f(x)=f(1)^(x), so to figure out the Best Solution to the Best Additive Rule, then we just have to figure out what f(1) is for a function that satisfies f\\'(x)=f(x) and f(0)=1. \\n\\nIf you recall the Taylor Series of a function (at x=0) is a way to write a function  as an \"infinite degree polynomial\" using it\\'s derivatives: \\n\\n* f(x) = f(0) +xf\\'(0)+x^(2)f\\'\\'(0)/2+x^(3)f\\'\\'\\'(0)/3!+x^(4)f\\'\\'\\'\\'(0)/4!+...\\n\\nBut in our case, we have f\\'(x)=f(x) and so f\\'(0)=f(0)=1. If we take the derivative of the equation f\\'(x)=f(x) we\\'ll get f\\'\\'(x)=f\\'(x), which is f(x) and so f\\'\\'(0)=f(0)=1. In this way, f^(n)(0)=1 for any derivative. So\\n\\n* f(x) = 1+x+x^(2)/2+x^(3)/3!+x^(4)/4!+...\\n\\nI can then plug in x=1 into this  to get f(1)=1+1+1/2+1/6+1/24+..., or the sum of 1/n! for n=0 to infinity. This means that the \"Best Solution to the Best Additive Rule\" is equal to f(x)=e^(x) where we set e=f(1)=1+1+1/2+1/6+1/24+....\\n\\nUsing the function exp(x)=e^(x), we can find all the other solutions to any additive rule f\\'(x)=Cf(x). Note that if f(x)=exp(Cx), then f\\'(x)=Cf(x). If we set a=f(1)=exp(C), then f(x)=a^(x). So C is some number so that a=e^(C) and we call such a number C=log(a), the natural log of a.\\n\\nEssentially, the reason we care about e is because exp(x)=e^(x) is a natural function that we can use it to classify all Additive Rules of Exponents.

This review was conducted to examine the medical literature to investigate if there is evidence  to support an improvement in clinical outcome following the use of ice or cryotherapy.  Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed and all human and animal trials or systematic reviews pertaining to soft tissue trauma, ice or cryotherapy were assessed. The clinically relevant outcome measures were: (1) a reduction in pain; (2) a reduction in swelling or edema; (3) improved function; or (4) return to participation in normal activity.Results: Six relevant trials in humans were identified, four of which lacked randomization and blinding. There were two wellconducted randomized controlled trials, one showing supportive evidence for the use of a cooling gel and the other not reaching statistical significance. Four animal studies showed that modest cooling reduced edema but excessive or prolonged cooling is damaging. There were two systematic reviews, one of which was inconclusive and the other suggested that ice may hasten return to participation.” Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence to suggest that cryotherapy improves clinical outcome in the management of soft tissue injuries.\"],\n",

Two of the biggest ones (labeled A and B below) are:\\n\\nA. The idea that \"intelligence\" is some sort of linear scale which, as intelligence increases, tends towards perfect, maximally efficient problem solving and decision making, with no tradeoffs, costs, or limits.  Future machine intelligence generations are imagined to simply march their way up this scale into unimaginable realms.\\n\\nBut all the evidence we have indicates that this notion of intelligence is simplistic to the point of absurdity.  This absurdity is reinforced by the boiling down of the complexity of intelligence - a quality that humans really haven\\'t yet understood well - into a single IQ score.  The fact that we give a single number to something we don\\'t understand well says more about our poor understanding of the subject than it does about intelligence itself.  (Of course, the science in this area has moved somewhat beyond single IQ scores, but singularity ideas are still stuck on this early 20th century notion.)\\n\\nThe best one can do in defense of the singularity here is to claim that well, *machine* intelligences won\\'t suffer from all the foibles that human intelligences do - but that\\'s pure ungrounded speculation that a bit of reasoning can easily poke holes in.  \\n\\nPoorly-defined extrapolations of the poorly-defined concept of intelligence can\\'t really be taken very seriously.\\n\\nB. Singularity ideas tend to pretend physical limits don\\'t exist, or will somehow be overcome by super-intelligence.  In fact, with a few exceptions, physics over the past century has found the opposite: that there are many fundamental physical limits that cannot be overcome even in principle.  One might speculate that singularity ideas are actually a reaction to and denial of these limits.\\n\\nIn short, singularity ideas in their most extreme forms, including Kurzweil\\'s, more closely resemble quasi-religious pseudoscience than anything with a sound rational or scientific basis.\\n\\nThis is all confused by the fact that it certainly seems possible or likely that as the human population increases, and our technology becomes more sophisticated, and if we don\\'t destroy our civilization along the way, the result will be something that still looks rather like a \"weak singularity\".  This is really just an extrapolation of the amazing technological progress we\\'ve made in the past century.  Most of the technology we rely so heavily on, like refrigerators, cars, and computers, are less than a century old.  \\n\\nBut in a world with physical and economic limits, extrapolating past performance only takes you so far.  In fact, you might be on firmer ground predicting a Great Plateau which will come once we hit a point at which further technological progress has diminishing returns economically.

In the paramagnetic case, it\\'s due to the fact that the magnetic moments in the material prefer to be aligned with the external magnetic field.\\n\\nLet me be more careful now about what is meant by ferromagnetism. Let\\'s assume for now, for simplicity, that your material looks the same under all rotations.\\n\\nFerromagnetism means that the magnetic moments in the material align \"spontaneously\", that is, in any infinitely tiny magnetic field. This is because the interactions between the magnetic moments favor them being aligned strongly enough that it overcomes the thermal energy associated with being disordered. In particular, the meaning is that there is, even in an infinitely tiny field, a large (i.e. not infinitely tiny) average magnetization in one direction.\\n\\nSo now, your question. What happens if you add an external magnetic field as you cool? Well, above the Curie point there will be magnetization due to the magnetic field. When you reach the Curie point, the material would have nonzero magnetization in zero field. But what your external field does is just increase that magnetization *at that temperature*. As you cool further, the magnetization will continue to increase, but the magnetic moments can\\'t get any more aligned than fully aligned. So at low temperatures, where in zero field the moments would be fully aligned anyways, there won\\'t be any difference if you apply the field.\\n\\nNow, there\\'s the subtle part of what happens when the magnetic moments in your material prefer to align along a particular direction (due to the material\\'s crystal structure or things like that). In that case, the same thing as above happens if you apply the field along the preferred direction. However, if you apply the field along a different direction, there\\'s now competition between the field and the preferred direction. Depending on how strong the field is and how strong the preference is, you may still go to a ferromagnetic phase at low temperature, but this time the magnetization will be smaller than if there was no field.

Hard to sum up the research better than they do. \\n\\n > When an overturning jet projecting from the crest in a breaking wave rebounds from the free water surface ahead, the strain is locally intensiﬁed between the secondary jet and the primary spanwise vortex behind it. Apparent instability in the saddle region where the maximum stretch occurs almost instantaneously triggers a threedimensional velocity ﬁeld at the plunging point. Thus, the spanwise undulation of the vorticity, arising from re-orientation of perturbations in the primary vorticity, is ﬁrst ampliﬁed in the saddle-point ﬂow and leads to a wavy vortex loop. At the initial stage of the formation of the vortex loop, the spanwise undulation of vorticity produces a spanwise pressure gradient near the surface and wraps the surface around the vortex axis, to form a ﬁnger-shaped rebounding jet. A stretch-and-intensiﬁcation process in the vortex loop along the principal axis of strain causes normal perturbations to a braid layer, by self-induction between counter-rotating vorticities at the bends of the vortex loop. The continual stretching of the vortex loop in the braid organizes a rib structure, in which the vortex loop envelops the upper part of a new primary vortex produced by the next plunging jet to the bottom of the previous primary vortex behind it.\\n\\n > Continual deformation of the large-scale vortices and the production of new smallerscale vortices are caused by local strains intensiﬁed among the vortices, even after the breaking front has passed. While some of the vortices dissipate via a cascade (scaling-down) process in the shear ﬁeld until the next breaking event, the remainder are transported in the reverse ﬂow to the next wave breaking point and may trigger further instabilities, leading to a rather complex three-dimensional vortex structure. Thus, especially in the case of a plunging breaker in shallow water, a number of the large-scale vortices are packed within a shallow ﬂuid region between the descending free surface and the bottom after the wave passes, which causes a more complex evolution of the vortex structure in the locally intensiﬁed strains between the closely packed vortices.\\n\\n_URL_0_'],\n",

Since there are no field lines in the central free space region, the little magnets representing the material of the shell on the inner surface of the shell have forces of the nearby little magnets pulling them tangential to the inner shell surface, but no force perpendicular the inner surface of the shell. Therefore, the little magnets all line up more or less tangential to the inner surface of the shell (depending on the thickness of the shell, the magnetic permeability of the shell, and the strength of the external field). Thus, field lines run into the shell, but then tangential to the inner surface of the shell. \\n\\nThe key points are that the shell is not infinitely thin and there is non-magnetic material or free space filling the region contained by the shell such that there is a magnetic material/non-magnetic material inner boundary.',\n",

       "  'text': ['Yes, here\\'s why.\\n\\nLet p be any point on Earth, and let f(p) be some function of p - it could be the pressure, or temperature, or humidity, or anything you like.  Let\\'s denote by -p the antipode of p.  Importantly, we want f to be continuous - it doesn\\'t jump around in value.  With me so far?\\n\\nNow I\\'m going to define a new function, g(p), as g(p)=f(p)-f(-p).  So it f is temperature, g(north pole)=(temp at north pole)-(temp at south pole).  Similarly, g(south pole)=(tempt at south pole)-(tempt at north pole).\\n\\nThink for a moment about why g(p)= -g(-p).  This is important.  Because if g(p)=0, then we\\'re done, f(p)=f(-p) and so we have two antipodal points which have the same f-value (be that temperature, pressure, whatever).  If g(p) is NOT zero, then it is either positive or negative.  Let\\'s say positive, without loss of generality.  That means g(-p) is negative.  Since f is continuous, g must be continuous as well, and so if we travel on a path from p to -p, g must take on all the values between g(p) and g(-p).  Since g(p) > 0 and g(-p) < 0, there must be a q on the path between them such that g(q)=0, and the means f(q)=f(-q).\\n\\nNote that this is true regardless of the path we take from p to -p; so if we do this with a whole bunch of different paths, we\\'ll get a \"ring\" of points with f(q)=f(-q) between p and -p.  We know it\\'s a ring and not a weird bunch of scattered points because f is continuous and hence g is continuous.  Since g is continuous, if we change the path we take from p to -p just a little bit, the values of g should only change a little bit - meaning the 0-point can\\'t suddenly jump far away.  So let\\'s denote by F this curve of points where f(p)=f(-p).\\n\\nF is composed exclusively of antipodal points, and so it separates the world into \"hemispheres\" just like the equator does, although they might not have a nice \"straight\" border like the equator.  Hence, this curve F has an interesting property that it separates all antipodal points.  We\\'re going to exploit that to finish the proof.\\n\\nLet h(p) be any other function, and define j(p)=h(p)-h(-p).  For exactly the same reasons as before, we get a ring of points q where h(q)=h(-q) between p and -p. Let\\'s call this curve H.  Since H is composed of antipodal points, F must intersect H because F separates any two antipodal points.  The point where F and H intersect, let\\'s call it r, must have f(r)=f(-r) AND h(r)=h(-r), because that\\'s what it means to be on the curves F and H respectively.  Hence, r and -r are a pair of antipodal points with the same f-value and the same h-value.  Substitute \"temperature\" for f and \"pressure\" for h, and you\\'re done.\\n\\nThis is all very real; notice all we needed was that f and h be continuous functions, and temperature and pressure are certainly continuous.  \\n\\nIncidentally, there\\'s another interesting theorem that states at any given time, there must be a point on Earth where the windspeed is precisely 0.

As the format expanded, the infrastructure of the site provided an effective means of delivering all kinds of content. With an ease-of-use system and the ever-expanding percentage of the populace that is using the Internet, a site like this was eventually going to attract an audience who sought easily consumable entertainment. It is not that intellectual users have eventually succumbed to the easy distractions, no, they are hiding out on smaller subreddits with decent communities. New users are using the site differently and bringing the junkfood with them.\\n\\n**However, this is not TheoryOfReddit so a bit of science:**\\n\\nI don\\'t fully understand why people are more attracted to entertainment beyond mere mundane explanations about it being quick and easy; there is also plenty that someone more qualified than me could offer about the subject, such as the brain\\'s reward system and the psychology of procrastination. I am not going to answer that question. However I would like to say two things you might find interesting through relation and hope people don\\'t mind me bringing in something a little off-topic though indirectly related:\\n\\n1) The world has *always been like this*. The vast majority of people do not seek out intellectually engaging activities, at least, *not all the time*. It\\'s just as likely that users engaged in meaningful and insightful subreddits are also indulging in crud as a kind of break. However, humanity at large prefers entertainment because life is hard and people want to escape, or because they just are not smart enough.\\n\\n**2) Actual science / psychology (almost):** This is a little bit tangential to what you have asked but I think it relates enough to be useful. One thing I find very interesting whenever this kind of discussion comes up about Reddit or mass media in general is the fact that some \\'intellectual types\\' become very angry or indignant about the wider populace for \\'dumbing down\\' or rejecting intellectual stimuli. I think this is because of a cognitive bias  called *The Fundamental Attribution Error*. This fancy name denotes the very simple observation that when assessing the actions of others, we tend to emphasize internal factors that are dictating a situation, rather than external. Personality traits, behavior, intellectual capability, reasoning - all these things are what we initially go to to explain why others act the way they do, rather than considering external and situational factors that may have had an impact.\\n\\nExamples are as simple as looking at a fat person and thinking \"God, why don\\'t they just see how easy it is to lose weight, why don\\'t the just put down the Twinkie and get some exercise - they are just stupid, or lazy or irresponsible and it is their own fault.\" Not everyone thinks this harshly but it is just a hyperbolic example. When we make these judgments, we tend to ignore the vast array of factors that are external; the person may have been bullied as a kid by his parents about his weight and have a complex, they may work in fast food joint and be too poor to eat anything other than the free food, or exercise may be so difficult for them after years of ignorance that they simply do not have the strength to \\'just get some exercise\\'. Assessments about behavior  ignore the complexity of individual lives in favor of a worldview based *on our own experience and self-knowledge.* We project onto others what we know of ourselves, rather than considering them unique.\\n\\nSome people believe this happens as a cognitive shortcut - a cost and energy saving practice design to minimize time and effort invested in making complex assessments, perhaps even an evolutionary consequence. Distractions such as compassion, accommodation and understanding can put the group into a situation where a weaker member is impeding the success of the whole due to a flaw that they carry. By demanding that others conform to our concept of beneficial behavior, we help ensure the survival of the group as want to see it, a view that favors our own influence and genes. Making judgments from behavior and personal experience is far easier and effective than using imagination to consider more sympathetic views. Yet this leads people into a world of immense double standards, especially as we also have a tendency to rationalize our own flaws because we have our own history and knowledge of external factors readily available from memory. If someone accuses *us* of being fat we can quickly and safely defend ourselves through recourse to how this happened.\\n\\nWhy do I mention this? In intellectual communities (like parts of Reddit) there is the same tendency to hold others to the same standards as ourselves and then deride them as stupid or irresponsible or flawed if they reject what we see as meaningful. I mean, c\\'mon, this is the lifeblood of /r/Atheism and it\\'s quickfire imagefest denouncing religion (which, as many realize, is a paradox of priding intellectual endeavor over ignorance, yet swarms with pictures, Facebook \\'caps and Rage comics). Even reasonable and discerning Redditors have a mild tendency to view the site as having been taken over by the ignorant masses with some element of believing this act to be willful. \"They are just not choosing the right stuff, why do they have to be so mindless.\" The great irony is that this judgment comes from the brain making a fast, easy psychological shortcut that ignores intellectual reasoning in favor of condemnation, rather than an insightful and well thought out perspective of understanding. In fact, this bias actually informs a huge part of modern political and economic philosophy, as well as the equality proposed by democracy and egalitarianism, even if people\\'s lives are far harder and more complex than the standards set for them. There is a huge array of factors applicable to millions of users, so there are innumerable reasons why people are drawn to entertainment other intellectual pursuit, yet we ignore this fact in favor of an easy worldview that sees them as ignorant.\\n\\nYou can check out a bit more about this [here](_URL_0_) and obviously [Here](_URL_1_).

For example, in order to p-dope silicon, you can add (neutral) boron atoms to a (neutral) chunk of silicon. Nowhere in this process did you add a net charge. \\n\\nWhat doping changes is not the macroscopic charge, but the number of mobile charge *carriers.* Take a look [at this diagram](_URL_0_). In an intrinsic semiconductor, a tiny amount of electrons will will have enough energy to jump from the valence band into the conduction band. As a result, the concentration of mobile electrons and holes will be equal. When you add boron to the silicon, the situation will be similar to panel c. The boron will soak up some electrons from the valence band of silicon, leaving behind mobile holes. As a result, you now have more mobile holes, but everything stays charge neutral. \\n\\nFinally, when you put an n-doped and a p-doped slab of silicon together, electrons will start flowing from the n-doped part to the p-doped part. This process will continue until you reach electrochemical equilibrium. Finally now you are creating a charged region at the boundary between the two sections. These opposing charges then give rise to the in-built field and the in-built potential.\",\n",
       "   \"You're just missing one key idea here. The dopant atoms are neutral so there is no net charge added to a material upon doping. Their effect comes from their electronic structure being different from the bulk material. So when they fit into the bulk lattice and covalently bond to the neighboring atoms, they will either fully bond and still have an extra free electron that is introduced in the material (n-type) or they will incompletely bond leaving a hole for an electron to fill (p-type). So doping just adds conduction electrons/holes. \\n\\n**So p-type and n-type materials are neutral.**\\n\\nAs for the electric field, when the p-type and n-type materials are brought together forming the junction, the higher concentration of conduction electrons in the n-type material relative to the p-type causes a diffusive current of electrons into the p-type material. So since they started off neutral, after some diffusing, a net positive region forms in the n-type and a net negative region forms in the p-type and thus there is an electric field pointing from the n-type to the p-type. Notice that the electric field is pointed such that it opposes the diffusive current. So the junction reaches a steady state electric field when that field balances with the diffusion.\"],\n",

In relativity, we use the word *event* to mean what is occurring at a certain location and at a certain time, so there is the *event* of you reading this now (location: wherever you are when you browse the web; time: whenever you read this post).  We will call this our base event.\\n\\nAll the rest of the events in the universe (each of which has a location and a time) can be divided into three categories:\\n\\n1. There are those events that you at the base event could in principle affect -- e.g., travel to or get a message to.\\n\\n2. There are those events that could, in principle, be affecting you at the base event -- e.g., agents at those events could have traveled to or sent a message to you at this point in space and time.\\n\\n3. There are those events that you at the base event could neither affect nor or be affected by.\\n\\nThings in Category 1 are events that are in the base event's *future*.  Since you can't travel faster than the speed of light, there are some events that would occur at a later time for you, but they are so far away, you could never reach them.  For example, if you wanted to influence the Mars Rover one second from the base event, you'd be out of luck; although it's at a later time as far as you're concerned, it is out of reach.  It is not in Category 1.\\n\\nThings in Category 2 are events that are in the base event's *past*.  Since nothing else can travel faster than the speed of light, there are some events that occur at an earlier time for you but which could not have affected you at the base event.  \\n\\nCategory 1 is called the base event's *future lightcone* in relativity, and Category 2 is called the base event's *past lightcone*.  Since nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, and since the speed of a light beam is the same relative to every observer, everybody in every reference frame will agree on which events are in the base event's future lightcone and which are in the base event's past lightcone.\\n\\nNow there is Category 3.  These are objects are said to be *spacelike* separated from you at the base event.  You can neither affect these or be affected by them.  It includes anything that occurs at the same time as the base event but at a different location, as well as things that occur at a later time according to your clocks but are far enough away that you couldn't get there (because you'd have to travel at a speed greater than the speed of light), and things that occur at an earlier time according to your clocks but are far enough away that they could not affect you (because they'd have to send something at a speed greater than the speed of light to reach you).\\n\\nRelativity tells us that exactly which events in Category 3 occur at the same time as, which occur later than, and which occur earlier than the base event will be different relative to different observers.  Since these events can't affect the base event and vice-versa, however, there is no problem with this; there is no way to conjure up a measurement that would be make an absolute determination of which came first, precisely because you can't have any of these affect the base event or vice-versa.\\n\\nNow I realize this doesn't tell you why relativity leads to this conclusion, but it should give you some understanding of why this conclusion of relativity does not lead to problems with past and future and cause and effect.\\n\\nEdit: Just fixed some language.\"],\n",

ADHD is usually treated with dopamine agonists and it is believed that individuals with ADHD have problems with dopamine signals. So we give them drugs that \"amplify\" dopamine signals similar to how we give deaf people devices that amplify auditory signals. Excessive intake of sugar in individuals with certain genetic predispositions may lead to a reduction of dopamine (D2) receptors. Why? The reward hub of your brain, the nucleus accumbens, adjusts to the relative sizes of rewards in your environment. When it has become adjusted to large rewards (sugar), it gets less sensitive to smaller rewards. This leads to problems of concentration and motivation. Bear in mind, this is just a hypothesis. \\n\\n > We postulate that sugar acutely increases dopamine, which, over time, leads to a reduced number of D2 receptors and possibly a reduction in extracellular dopamine itself, leading to desensitization of this dopamine signaling axis.

Anything between observations is pretty much outside the realm of science to answer. But we can have some pretty informed *guesses* as to what happens.\\n\\nSo let\\'s suppose we have a particle pass through a single slit. The slit is vertically oriented, therefore it measures the particle\\'s position along the *horizontal* axis. Any particle passing through the slit has been \"observed\" to be at some position, x with some error dx (the width of the slit, eg). Now we don\\'t know what happens to it, but then it strikes a back wall, leaving some impact (perhaps making the wall glow there, or the particle is itself light, or electronic detection or something).\\n\\nWhat you\\'ll find is that the particle impacts *spread out* along that horizontal axis. There was some uncertainty in their *horizontal momentum* at the first measurement when you asked \"where they were.\" And that uncertainty in momentum means they spread out on the back wall. \\n\\nSo from that first slit, we realize we can\\'t tell directly what momentum the particle has until we see it impact the far wall, and then can measure the momentum. \\n\\nSo then the question is... does that particle have that momentum when it leaves the slit, or does it only \"realize\" one momentum state after it\\'s hit the wall behind it? (or one of the many other quantum interpretations here)\\n\\nBroadly we can divide these guesses as to what happens between observations into 2 camps (this need not be the only way to divide them, but it\\'s the one most relevant to this question). One camp says *something, even if we can\\'t measure it directly, encodes the particle\\'s momentum and other quantum properties*. The other camp says *the particle doesn\\'t truly have a specific momentum until it\\'s measured that second time*. \\n\\nAnd then we come across Bell\\'s theorem. This theorem states that the first camp can be right, but if it is, then information about measurement setups must be able to travel faster than light somehow. Or the second camp can be correct, that quantum properties are truly in superpositions until measurement, but information doesn\\'t travel faster than light. But you can\\'t have both hidden variables (the first camp) and the speed-of-light limitation on information. \\n\\nAnd here is where it\\'s up to you to decide which you prefer.

Of 60 persons who died in the United States, most developed cardiac complications after a loss of ∼30% of initial weight, achieved in an average of 4 months.

The inside of these blocked follicles then gets colonised by skin flora - mainly one called Propionibacterium Acnes.  These cause inflammation and those pesky spots we all hate/hated!\\n\\nNow BPO is an organic compound which penetrates down into the follicles.  BPO is an oxidising compound and creates free radicals, these free radicals have an antibacterial effect (note: BPO is NOT an antibiotic)  This effect has not been shown to increase resistance of bacteria unlike oral and topical antibiotic therapies.\\n\\nSo now we know that using BPO has an anti bacterial effect and this helps reduce them nasty red spots, coupled with the moisturising effects of the rest of proactiv you are doing quite a lot to treat acne.\\n\\nAs for effects of stopping BPO there is very little literature on the effects on pubmed or on the web in general, apart from anecdotal stuff on forums, my hypothesis is therefore this:  Proactiv and it's constituents do not change the make up of your skin as such and you do not get used to them, however stopping the treatment allows the regrowth of a previously suppressed bacterium and allows the acne to flare back up.  Proactiv is meant to treat the cause of the bad spots while waiting for us to naturally grow out of acne, which can take 5+ years.\\n\\nN.B. I read Wikipedia before beginning a lit review for this answer, it mentions that BPO increases skin turnover and links to a medscape article.  While the medscape article is a good introductory read I could not find any referenced mention of increasing skin turnover and so have not mentioned it here.\",\n",

I want to start working out to build muscle mass.\\nSome of my friends say masturbation will increase testosterone, but others say it will decrease testosterone. What effect will masturbation have?\\n\\nMasturbation is very unlikely to decrease testosterone levels. Semen is not the source of testosterone, and ejaculation will not cause testosterone levels to go down.\\n\\nAll other things being equal, increased sexual activity -- including masturbation -- tends to increase testosterone levels. But these levels depend upon many factors including age, time of day, overall level of physical activity, and general health. Psychological factors can cause changes in testosterone levels: levels go up in men who believe they are going to become more sexually active, levels can be affected by whether a person knows in advance that he will be test for testosterone, and so forth.\\n\\nIn your case, the increase in physical activity accompanying your workouts will probably have a much greater effect on your testosterone levels. If you are a young male AND working out, your testosterone level is likely to be so high that any difference masturbation (or other sexual activity) might make will be insignificant.\\n\\nIn much older men (over 40 years old), especially those with fewer sexual activities of other kinds, masturbation might increase testosterone levels significantly--which is not to suggest that masturbation might replace a reasonable program of physical exercise.\\n\\nAlthough athletes were once advised to avoid sexual activities (including masturbation) *immediately* before athletic performances, studies have not found any scientific basis for this advice. So far as I know there have been no studies of the effects of abstinence *throughout* training, and probably there won\\'t be because it would be difficult to find athletes who would agree to be abstinent for a prolonged time and no way to tell whether they really were. At any rate, nothing special about masturbation would cause it to have a bigger effect for better or worse than any other kind of sexual activity.\"\\n\\n\\nI would like to point out that the increased confidence may possibly come from the self-control involved in not masturbating.

During beta decay, the emitted electrons preferentially favor one kind of spin. That\\'s right, the parity of the universe is not conserved in nuclear decay. These chiral electrons once again preferrentially degrade D amino acids vs. L amino acids.\\n\\nThus due to the chirality of sunlight and the chirality of nuclear radiation, L amino acids are the more stable enantiomers and therefore are favored for abiogenesis.\" - MT Headed @ SDN.\\n\\n\"In the [Wikipedia] article \"abiogenesis\" look for section \"Models to explain homochirality\".\\nIn the article \"circular polarization\" look for the section \"starlight\".\\nIn the article \"Parity (physics)\" look for the section \"Parity violation\".\\n\\nI also followed several footnotes to read the original journal articles.\"\\n\\n_URL_0_',\n",

Each gene copy can be slightly different from one another, and different combination will give predictable physical traits. For example, imagine that one flower inherits a deficient gene in flower color from one parent. This child flower may not be able to produce as bright and vibrant a color as it is supposed to, but it can do ok and survive just fine. If that child flower mates with another flower like it, there is a possibility that the offspring will not live. That\\'s because this gene may be important, and control more than just flower color.

Because your equation applies to a closed loop in a circuit. \\n\\nLet's say the plate is a small metal plate, and it only contains a limited amount of energy. What happens if you touch the plate while standing on the ground? Your body is about 500 ohms, you are closing the circuit, so the equation applies. In theory, the current is I=V/R = 200 amps. Enough to perform welding... So, obviously something doesn't add up. What about power? P=I*V, so therefore you have 200A*100,000V = \\n20,000,000 Watts. This is basically on the level of a turbine for generating energy. \\n\\nSo, whats missing? What's missing is the understand of the actual amount of energy available from the metal plate. It's pretty small (it's handheld, powered off a battery/capacitor). So, let's say there is actually 1 watt of power available in a taser, that means if you charge it up to 100,000 volts, you will have I=P/V = 1W/100,000V = 10 micro amps. Therefore, they say, low current, high voltage. It gives a shock for a short amount of time. It runs out of energy so fast, it never reaches the steady state equation you mentioned.

Going without sleep for 9 days is not very good for you but is outside the 'known' fatal range for sleep deprivation in humans. Going without water for 9 days is impossible. During this ritual, they are getting water from  **somewhere** if they realize it or not. Maybe they chew a root? Maybe they bathe in the water and 'accidently' swallow some? Maybe they cheat? Outside of controlled conditions with constant observation, it's impossible to tell. (And conveniently in many of these cases people are never allowed near the 'sacrificial well'. I remember one 'holy man' who went weeks without food and water. Except the 'scientists' with him let him bathe for 30 minutes with no observation and go for a 30 minute walk each day with no observation.) As to running 30 km a day on 1450 calories (in mountains no less!), I am suspicious. Calorie counters I'm finding online indicate someone who weighs 120 pounds would burn approximately 1700 calories running that distance. That doesn't account for basal metabolism they'd have outside of running. There are certain biomechanical rules that must be followed. It's also (likely) possible whoever calculated 1450 calories was being optimistic. (It does not appear they grabbed the food every day and ran bomb calorimetry on it. Also, they only observed his diet in one season.)\\n\\nI'd suspect, like most myth and folklore, it's part cheating, part miscounting, and part impressive. Of course we don't know, there is no science done here, only anecdote. (Don't get me wrong, running a marathon everyday for 7 years and staying awake 9 days straight are both very impressive, they just aren't that far out of what people are known to be able to do.) If something seems completely impossible, it often is. An extraordinary claim like this would require a lot of evidence.\\n\\nEDIT: It appears they are only running 100 days a year and are actually kind of walking more than running.
